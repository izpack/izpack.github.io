## Direct installer download

The current legacy release is **IzPack 4.3.5**.
We encourage you to migrate to the latest release **IzPack 5.2.3**.

* [Download the installer for IzPack 5.2.3](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/codehaus/izpack/izpack-dist/5.2.3/izpack-dist-5.2.3.jar)
* [Download the standalone compiler for IzPack (legacy version) 4.3.5](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/org/codehaus/izpack/izpack-standalone-compiler/4.3.5/)

Launching an IzPack-based installer is easy. On most operating systems, a double-click on the Jar file icon will do. Otherwise, you may need to launch it from a shell command:

    $ java -jar izpack-dist-5.2.3-installer.jar

If you are interested in the source code then please have a look at the [instructions for obtaining it from Git](/developers/).

## Graphical user interfaces

<h3>DCP Setup Maker</h3>
[DCP Setup Maker](http://www.devcompack.com/setupmaker/) is an opensource project, powered by IzPack and developed by SAID EL IMAM Said,
that generates java installers easily for a set of files, without the need of coding knowledge.
It automatically writes the xml code, and compiles it for you.

<h3>PackJacket</h3>
The independent [PackJacket](http://packjacket.sf.net/) opensource project offers a convenient graphical user interface for creating IzPack-based installers.

## Native launchers

IzPack 4 came along with a simple Windows native launcher that could check for the presence of a Java Runtime, and install it if need be. This launcher is currently not supported in IzPack 5 due to a missing maintainer for this feature.
If you like to take care about this just join us!

You may alternatively look at the independent [JSmooth](http://jsmooth.sourceforge.net/) and [Launch4J](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) opensource projects. Lots of users have had positive experiences mixing them with IzPack based installers!
