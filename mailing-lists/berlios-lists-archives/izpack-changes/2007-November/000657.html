-Desktop Shortcuts
-=================
-
-(by Elmar GROM and Marc EPPELMANN)
-
-Defining Shortcuts
-------------------
-
-
-Introduction
-'''''''''''''
-
-On todays GUI oriented operating systems, users are used to launching
-applications, view web sites, look at documentation and perform a variety of
-other tasks, by simply clicking on an icon on the desktop or in a menu system
-located on the desktop. Depending on the operating system these icons have
-different names. In this context we will refer to them collectively as
-shortcuts.
-
-
-Apart from actually placing an application on the target system, users
-routinely expect an installer to create the necessary shortcuts for the
-application as well. For you as application developer, this means that for a
-professional appearance of your product you should also consider creating
-shortcuts.
-
-
-In contrast to the general specification of an IzPack installer, the
-specification of shortcuts in IzPack requires a little more effort. In
-addition, some of the concepts are a bit more complex and there are some
-operating system specific issues to observe. Fortunately, you only need to
-worry about operating system specifics if you want to deploy your application
-to multiple different operating systems. In any case, it will pay off to
-spend some time to study this documentation and the example spec files before
-you start to implement your own shortcuts.
-
-
-At the time of writing this Chapter the current IzPack Version 3.7.0-M3 is
-only capable to creating shortcuts on
-
-1.  Microsoft Windows, and
-2.  Unix and Unix-based operating systems (like Linux), which use the
-    `X11` GUI-System and ` FreeDesktop.org` based shortcut handling (such
-    as `KDE` and `Gnome`).
-
-Other operating or GUI systems, such as MacOS X are not
-supported. However, there is a special UI-variant that automatically pops up
-on unsupported systems. It informs the user about the intended targets of
-your shortcuts and allows the user to save this information to a text file.
-While this is not an elegant solution, at least it aids the user in the
-manual creation of the shortcuts.
-
-
-If you would like to review what an end user would see if the target
-operating system is not supported, you can do the following. Simply place the
-tag ``&lt;notSupported/&gt;`` in the spec file. This tag requires no attributes or
-other data. It must be placed under ``&lt;shortcuts&gt;``, just like the individual
-shortcut specifications. Be sure to remove this tag before getting your
-application ready for shipment.
-
-
-We expect other operating systems to be supported in the near future and as
-always, contributions are very welcome. At present someone is actively
-working on Mac support.
-
-
-What to Add to the Installer
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-There are some things that you have to add to your installer to enable
-shortcut creation. Obviously you need to add the panel responsible for
-creating shortcuts. This panel is aptly enough called ShortcutPanel. However,
-in order for the ShortcutPanel to work properly a number of additional items
-are required. These must be added manually to the installer, as all other
-resourcs, since the front-end will be rewritten. In this chapter we will
-explain which of these items are required and for what reason.
-
-
-First, we would like to discuss items that are supplied with IzPack and only
-need to be added to the installer. After that, we move on to the things you
-have to prepare yourself before you can add them. The way in which shortcuts
-are created varies widely among operating systems. In some cases it is
-possible to do this with pure Java code, while other systems -such as MS-
-Windows- require native code to accomplish this task. On the other side, the
-current implementation, which creates shortcuts on Unix based systems needs
-no native library at all, since it works with 'these' pure Java code. The
-native library required for the Windows operating systems are supplied with
-IzPack is called ``ShellLink.dll``. Note: They will not be automatically
-added to your installer file. You need to list them yourself in the XML file
-for the installer. A describtion how to do this follows in the next section.
-
-
-Native libraries can be added to the installer by using the ``&lt;native&gt;`` tag.
-To add the ``ShellLink.dll``, you just have to add the following line to the
-installer XML file:
-``&lt;native type=&quot;izpack&quot; name=&quot;ShellLink.dll&quot;/&gt;``
-For more details about the use of the ``&lt;native&gt;`` tag see the chapter about
-the format of the XML file.
-
-
-You have also to add an extra specification file for each platform family to
-enable shortcut creation on these platforms. At least one (the default file)
-is required by the shortcut panel. The format of all spec files is XML and
-they must be added to the installer as a resource. The source name of this
-specification does not matter, however its resource name (also called id or
-alias) when added to the installer must be ``(prefix)+shortcutSpec.xml``.
-At this release, there are only two prefixes supported: &quot;Win&quot; for the
-Windows family and &quot;Unix&quot; for all Unixes. If the prefix is ommited the
-shortcut panel searches for a named resource: `` shortcutSpec.xml``. This is
-the default resource name. As the default resource name will be used on
-Windows platforms, the ``&quot;Win_shortcutSpec.xml&quot;`` can be ommited.
-Hint: If the shortcut panel does not find one of these named resources, it
-will never appears. So, do not use different resource names and do not add a
-path to these.
-
-
-**Example**
-
-
-::
-
-    &lt;res src=&quot;C:\MyDocuments\Installer\default_shortcut_specification.xml&quot;
-         id=&quot;shortcutSpec.xml&quot;/&gt;
-    &lt;res src=&quot;C:\MyDocuments\Installer\unix_shortcut_specification.xml&quot;
-         id=&quot;Unix_shortcutSpec.xml&quot;/&gt;
-
-
-Why use different shortcut spec files?
-
-
-1.  The Target filenames are most different.(batch files on Windows vs.
-    shell scripts on Unix.)
-2.  The Icon file formats are different. ICOs on Windows-, PNGs on Unix-
-    platforms.
-3.  The Target locations can be different.
-
-This is the simple reason.
-
-
-
-Why Native Code to do the Job on Windows?
------------------------------------------
-
-by Elmar
-
-
-This little chapter is not strictly part of the documentation but i have been
-asked this question sufficiently often that i think it's worth explaining
-right here. It is certainly a natural question to ask. After all IzPack is an
-application completely written in Java and primarily targeted for the
-installation of Java based programs. So why wouldn't we try to keep
-everything pure Java and avoid the use of native code altogether? There must
-be some personal preference of the developer hidden behind this approach you
-might think. Well, not really, but i admit at first it seems quite feasible
-to write it all in Java. On virtually any operating system or GUI surface
-around, Shortcuts are simply files on the local file system. Files can be
-created and accessed directly from within Java, so why should there be a need
-for using native code?
-
-
-Well, it turns out that just creating a file is not good enough, it also
-needs to have the right content. Shell Links as they are called in Windows
-land are binary files. i actually managed to find documentation on the
-format. Naturally this was hacker data, you won't get this sort of thing from
-Microsoft (by the way: thanks a lot to Jesse Hager for a smash job!). Armed
-with this information i tried to create these files myself in Java. The
-problem was that the documentation was not entirely accurate and had some
-gaps as well. i tried for over a month to get this to work but finally i had
-to give up. Even if i would have succeeded, it would have been a hack, since
-a shell link requires some information that is impossible to obtain from
-within Java. Usually you can successfully create a shell link by only filling
-in the bare minimum information and then ask Windows to resolve the link.
-Windows then repairs the shell link. Unfortunately this was only the
-beginning, soon i encountered a host of other problems. For one thing, the
-installer needs to know the correct directories for placing the links and it
-turns out they are named differently in different countries. In addition,
-there are ways of manually modifying them, which some people might actually
-have done. The only way to place the shortcut files reliably is through
-accessing the Windows Registry. Naturally, this operation also required
-native code. Same thing with asking Windows to resolve the link... On the
-bottom line, at every step and turn you run into an issue where you just need
-to use native code to do the trick. So i decided that i would do it the
-proper way all the way through. That is in a nutshell the reason why i used
-native code to create shortcuts on MS-Windows.
-
-
-As i am writing this i am at work with a friend to replicate this work for
-the Mac and it looks very much like we need to take the same approach there
-as well. On the various Unix GUIs on the other hand, we are lucky that we can
-do the job without native libraries.
-
-
-
-The Shortcut Specification
---------------------------
-
-As we say above, the specification for shortcuts is provided to the
-ShortcutPanel in the XML fileformat. At the time of this writing (for IzPack
-version 3.7.0-M3) the front-end will be rewritten. Until these work is in
-progress you have to write the specification files manually. For your
-convenience, there are two annotated sample specification files in the sample
-subdirectory of your IzPack installation. At the beginning you might want to
-experiment with these files.
-
-
-Both specification files have one root element called ``&lt;shortcuts&gt;``. This
-root elements recognizes 3 different child elements:
-``&lt;programGroup&gt;``, ``&lt;skipIfNotSupported/&gt;`` and ``&lt;shortcut&gt;``.
-
-
-``&lt;skipIfNotSupported/&gt;`` can be used to avoid the panel to show the
-alternative UI which shows the shortcut information that would have been
-created on a system that supports it. In other words, using this tag will
-make the panel be silent on non-supported systems. The default is to show the
-alternative UI.
-
-
-The ``&lt;programGroup&gt;`` tag allows you to specify the name of the menu, or
-more precise, the folder in which the shortcuts will be grouped. The exact
-location and appearance of the program group depends on the specific target
-system on which the application will be installed, however you can partially
-control it. Please note that ``&lt;programGroup&gt;`` may only appear once in the
-specification. If more than one instance occurs, only the first one will be
-used. This tag requires two attributes: ``defaultName`` and ``location``.
-``defaultName`` specifies the name that the group menu should have on the
-target system. You should be aware that the ShortcutPanel will present this
-name to the user as a choice. The user can then edit this name or select a
-group that already exists. As a result, there is no guarantee that the actual
-name of the program group on the target system is identical with your
-specification. ``location`` specifies where the group menu should show up.
-There are two choices: ``applications`` and ``startMenu``. If you use
-``applications``, then the menu will be placed in the menu that is ordinarily
-used for application shortcuts. ``applications`` is recommended for Unix
-shortcuts. If you use ``startMenu``, the group menu will be placed at the top
-most menu level available on the target system. Depending on the target
-system, it might not be possible to honor this specification exactly. In such
-cases, the ShortcutPanel will map the choice to the location that most
-closely resembles your choice. Unix shortcuts do not need to support the
-``startMenu``, because the ``applications`` menu is already on the highest
-level. This means this has no affect on thess platform.
-
-
-For each shortcut you want to create, you have to add one ``&lt;shortcut&gt;`` tag.
-Most details about the shortcut are listed as attributes with this tag. The
-following sections describe what each attribute does, which attributes are
-optional and which ones are required and what the values are that are
-accepted for each of the attributes. Note that all attributes that have a
-yes/no choice can also be omitted. Doing so has the same effect as using a
-value of no. The shortcut attributes can be divided into two groups
-
-
--   attributes that describe properties of the shortcut
--   attributes that define the location(s) at which a copy of the
-    shortcut should be placed.
-
-The following attributes are used to define location:
-
--   ``programGroup``
--   ``desktop``
--   ``applications``
--   ``startMenu``
--   ``startup``
-
-
-Shortcut Attributes
--------------------
-
-There are three classes of attributes. Some are required, most are completely
-optional and some are semi-optional. The set of semi-optional attributes are
-all the attributes used to define the location of a shortcut. These are semi-
-optional because for any individual one it is your choice if you want to
-include it or not. However they are not completely optional. You must specify
-at least one location. If all were omitted, the instruction would essentially
-tell the panel that a copy of this shortcut is to be placed at no location.
-In other words no copy is to be placed anywhere.
-
-**name** ``- required``
-
-
-The value of this attribute defines the name that the shortcut will have.
-This is the text that makes up the menu name if the shortcut is placed in a
-menu or the caption that is displayed with the shortcut if it is placed on
-the desktop.
-
-
-**target** ``- required``
-
-
-The value of this attribute points to the application that should be launched
-when the shortcut is clicked. The value is translated through the variable
-substitutor. Therefore variables such as ``$INSTALL_PATH`` can be used to
-describe the location. **You should be aware that the use of this tag is
-likely to change once other operating systems are supported**.
-
-
-**commandLine** ``- optional``
-
-
-The value of this attribute will be passed to the application as command
-line. i recommend to work without command line arguments, since these are not
-supported by all operating systems. As a result, your applications will not
-be portable if they depend on command line arguments. Instead, consider using
-system properties or configuration files.
-
-
-**workingDirectory** ``- optional``
-
-
-This attribute defines the working directory for the application at the time
-it is launched. i would recommend some caution in relying on this too heavily
-if your application should be portable, since this might not be supported by
-all operating systems. At this time i don't have enough information to make a
-definite statement one way or the other. The value is translated through the
-variable substitutor. Therefore variables such as ``$INSTALL_PATH`` can be
-used to describe the directory.
-
-
-**description** ``- optional``
-
-
-The value of this attribute will be visible to the user when a brief
-description about associated application is requested. The form of the
-request and the way in which this description is displayed varies between
-operating systems. On MS-Windows the description is shown as a tool tip when
-the mouse cursor hovers over the icon for a few seconds. On some operating
-systems this feature might not be supported but i think it is always a good
-idea to include a brief description.
-
-
-**iconFile** ``- optional``
-
-
-The value of this attribute points to the file that holds the icon that
-should be displayed as a symbol for this shortcut. This value is also
-translated through the variable substitutor and consequently can contain
-variables such as $INSTALL_PATH. If this attribute is omitted, no icon will
-be specified for the shortcut. Usually this causes the OS to display an OS
-supplied default icon. **The use of this attribute is also likely to change
-once other operating systems are supported. Read the Section about Icons
-below, for more information.**
-
-
-**iconIndex** ``- optional``
-
-
-If the file type for the icon supports multiple icons in one file, then this
-attribute may be used to specify the correct index for the icon. i would also
-advise against using this feature, because of operating system
-incompatibilities in this area. In file formats that do not support multiple
-icons, this values is ignored.
-
-
-**initialState** ``- optional``
-
-
-There are four values accepted for this attribute: ``noShow``, ``normal``,
-``maximized`` and ``minimized``. If the target operating system supports this
-feature, then this value will have the appropriate influence on the initial
-window state of the application. ``noShow`` is particularly useful when
-launch scripts are used that cause a command window to open, because the
-command window will not be visible with this option. For instance on MS-
-Windows starting a batch file that launches a Java application has the less
-than pretty side effect that two windows show: the DOS command prompt and the
-Java application window. Even if the shortcut is configured to show
-minimized, there are buttons for both windows in the task bar. Using
-``noShow`` will completely eliminate this effect, only the Java application
-window will be visible. *On Unix use* ``normal`` *, because this is not
-supported*.
-
-
-**programGroup** ``- semi-optional``
-
-
-The value for this attribute can be either yes or no. Any other value will be
-interpreted as no. If the value is yes, then a copy of this shortcut will be
-placed in the group menu. *On Unix (KDE) this will always be placed on the
-top level.*
-
-
-**desktop** ``- semi-optional``
-
-
-For this attribute the value should also be yes or no. If the value is yes,
-then a copy of the shortcut is placed on the desktop. *On Unix the shortcuts
-will only be placed on the (KDE-) desktop of the user, who currently runs the
-installer. For Gnome the user can simply copy the *.desktop files from*
-``/Desktop`` *to* ``/gnome-desktop``. (This is already a TODO for the Unix-
-shortcut implementation.)
-
-
-**applications** ``- semi-optional``
-
-
-This is also a yes/no attribute. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
-shortcut is placed in the applications menu (if the target operating system
-supports this). This is the same location as the applications choice for the
-program group. *This makes no sense on Unix.*
-
-
-**startMenu** ``- semi-optional``
-
-
-This is a yes/no attribute as well. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
-shortcut is placed directly in the top most menu that is available for
-placing application shortcuts. *This is not supported on Unix. see above.*
-
-
-**startup** ``- semi-optional``
-
-
-This is also a yes/no attribute. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
-shortcut is placed in a location where all applications get automatically
-started at OS launch time, if this is available on the target OS. *This is
-also not supported on Unix.*
-
-
-
-Unix specific shortcut attributes
-----------------------------------
-
-This extension was programmed by MARC EPPELMANN. This is still in development
-and may be changed in one of the next releases of IzPack.
-
-
-**type** ``- required``
-
-
-This must be one of ``Application`` or ``Link``
-
-
--   Application: To start any application, native, Java or shell-script
-    based, the **type** has to be ``Application``. The GUI-System will launch
-    this Application, so as is, thru their native shell or application
-    launcher. In this case, note that the right ``workingDirectory`` is
-    always important on Unix platforms. If the users PATH environment
-    variable does not contain the path, where the application is located,
-    this can never be run, until the ``workingDirectory`` does not contain
-    these path. The needed current path: &quot;.&quot;, this is the case on most
-    systems, should be in the users PATH environment variable. Consult the
-    Unix manuals for more details.
--   Link: If you want to open a URL in the users default Webbrowser, you
-    have to set the **type** to ``Link``. Note: The ``url`` attribute must be
-    set to work properly.
--   Other: There are more supported types on KDE, like FSDevice, but
-    these types makes no sense for IzPack, in my opinion.
-
-Without the type the Unix shortcut does not work.
-
-
-**url** ``- semi-optional``
-
-
-If you want to create a shortcut as type *Link*, then you have to set the
-``url`` attribute. The value can be a locally installed html or another
-document, with a known MIME type, like plain text, or a WWW Url i.e.
-'<A HREF="http://izpack.org/'.">http://izpack.org/'.</A>
-
-
-A local document can be referenced by i.e. &quot;$INSTALL_PATH/doc/index.html&quot;.
-
-
-The IzPack variable substitution system is supported by the **url**.
-
-
-**encoding** ``- required``
-
-
-This should always set to **UTF-8**.
-
-
-**terminal** ``- optional``
-
-
-If you want, the user can see the console output of a program (in Java
-applications &quot;System.outs&quot;), set the ``terminal`` attribute to **true**.
-
-
-**KdeSubstUID** ``- unused``
-
-
-This is not fully implemented by IzPack. i the future this is the sudo option
-for a shortcut.
-
-
-
-Selective Creation of Shortcuts
--------------------------------
-
-Usually all shortcuts that are listed will be created when the user clicks
-the 'Next' button. However it is possible to control to some degree if
-specific shortcuts should be created or not. This is based on install
-conditions. By including one or more ``&lt;createForPack name=''a pack name''
-/&gt;`` tags in the specification for a shortcut, you can direct the
-ShortcutPanel to create the shortcut only if any of the listed packs are
-actually installed. The 'name' attribute is used to define the name of one of
-the packs for which the shortcut should be created. You do not need to list
-all packs if a shortcut should always be created. In this case simply omit
-this tag altogether.
-
-
-**A word of caution**
-
-
-For any shortcut that is always created, i would recommend to omit this tag,
-since i have seen a number of problems related to changing pack names. You
-can save yourself some troubleshooting and some Aspirin by not using this
-feature if it's not required. On the other hand if you need it i would advise
-to be very careful about changing pack names.
-
-
-
-DesktopShortcutCheckboxEnabled Builtin Variable
------------------------------------------------
-
-``$DesktopShortcutCheckboxEnabled`` : When set to true, it automatically
-checks the &quot;Create Desktop Shortcuts&quot; button. To see how to use it, go to
-`The Variables Element ``&lt;variables&gt;``
-
-Be careful this variable is case sensitve !
-

-Shortcut Tips
--------------
-
-I wrote this section to provide additional information about issues
-surrounding the creation of shortcuts. Reading this section is not necessary
-to successfully create shortcuts, but it might help you creating an
-installation that works more smoothly. In addition, it might give you some
-knowledge about operating systems that you don't know so well. In fact most
-of the issues described in this section are focused on differences in
-operating system specifics.
-
-
-The Desktop
-'''''''''''
-
-You should recognize that the desktop is precious real estate for many
-people. They like to keep it uncluttered and keep only the things there that
-they use on a regular basis. This is not true for everybody and you might
-personally think different about this. Still, the fact remains that a lot of
-people might have different feelings about it, so you should not
-automatically assume that it is ok to place all of your shortcuts on the
-desktop proper. While your application is certainly one of the most important
-things for you, for your customers it is probably one of many applications
-they use and maybe not even the most important one. Accordingly, placing more
-shortcut icons there than they feel they will use on a regular basis and
-especially doing this without asking for permission might trigger some bad
-temper.
-
-
-Annotation: But even the experienced user should be able to organize their
-Desktop. On Linux the users desktop is the only place, which supports any
-kind of shortcuts.
-
-
-It is common practice to create a program group in the application menu
-system of the OS and place all shortcuts that go with an application in that
-program group. In addition, only one shortcut to the key access point of the
-application is placed directly on the desktop. Many installers first ask for
-permission to do so, as does the ShortcutPanel in IzPack.
-
-
-I would like to recommend that you always create a shortcut in the menu
-system, even if your application has only one access point and you are
-placing this on the desktop. Note that shortcuts can also be placed directly
-in the menu, they don't need to be in a program group. There are two reasons
-for doing so.
-
-
--   If the user elects not to create shortcuts on the desktop, they will
-    end up with no access point to your application
--   Even if this works fine, occasionally people 'clean up' their
-    desktop. They might later find that they accidentally deleted the only
-    access point to your application. For the less technology savvy users,
-    recreating the shortcut might be a rough experience.
-
-
-Icons
-''''''
-
-Icons are supplied in image files, usually in some kind of bitmap format.
-Unfortunately there is no format that is universally recognized by all
-operating systems. If you would like to create shortcuts on a variety of
-operating systems that use your own icons, you must supply each icon in a
-number of different formats. This chapter discusses icon file formats used on
-various operating systems. Fortunately there are good programs available that
-allow you to convert between these formats, so that creating the different
-files is not much of a problem once the icons themselves are created.
-
-
-**Microsoft Windows**
-
-
-Windows prefers to use its native icon file format. Files of this type
-usually use the extension .ico. These so called ICO files can hold multiple
-icons in one file, which can be useful if the same icon is to be provided in
-a number of sizes and color-depths.
-
-Windows itself selects the icon with the most matching dimensions and
-displays it. While the Start menu displays the icon with 16x16 pixel if
-available, the desktop displays the 32x32 pixel resolution of the same ICO if
-this is in.
-
-In other words, a ICO file has embedded one or more dimensions of the same
-Icon. We recommend to play with `microangelo`.
-
-Dlls and Exe files on the other side, can store, amongst other things, a
-collection of different Icons. You can select your desired Icon by its index.
-The lowest index is 0. Use the iconIndex attribute in the spec file to
-specify this index.
-
-
-As a sample look into
-
-::
-
-    %SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll
-
-
-These contains a lot of Windows own icons. You can use the `PE Explorer` or
-another Resource Editor to extract or modify Icons in dlls or exe files. But
-be warned. You can also destroy a working application with these kind of
-tools.
-
-At least Windows also supports the use of bitmap files in the .bmp format as
-icons. Note that this format does not support multiple icons.
-
-
-We might have overlooked other file formats that are supported by Windows.
-However, we suggest to test other formats for compatibility as they might not
-work all the way back to Windows 95 or on the NT/non-NT strain. Sticking with
-one of these two formats should keep you out of trouble.
-
-
-**Apple**
-
-
-Apple Macintosh systems use the Macintosh PICT format, extension .pct. If
-you are working with an apple system you know a whole lot more about this
-format than i do. If you don't but would like to be able to install your
-application on a Mac, simply start with any bitmap format that you feel
-comfortable to work with. Then find an application that is capable of
-converting this format into a .pct file. i like to use Paint Shop Pro (PC
-based), because it provides conversion capabilities among several dozen
-different file formats.
-
-
-**UNIX flavors**
-
-
-by Marc Eppelmann
-
-
-As my knowledge, all X based Unix Window systems supports the (ASCII-) XBM
-(X-Bitmap ) and the better XPM (X-PixMap) format. The modern GUI systems like
-KDE and Gnome can display additionally a lot of other ImageIcon formats, such
-as GIF, JPG, and PNG.
-
-
-i suggest to use PNG, because this can lossless compress like the GIF format,
-however this format is absolutely free. And not least, this can store true
-transparency informations (It has an alpha channel).
-
-
-Targets
-''''''''
-
-So, you thought you could escape the ugly mess of operating system
-dependencies at least with the way how your Java application is started?
-Sorry but i have just another bad message. The one positive thing is that
-here you have a way of escaping, even if doing so has a few less pretty side
-effects. At first, i would like to discuss various launching options you have
-available on different operating systems. At the end of the chapter i write
-about a way to make launching your application OS independent.
-
-
-**Microsoft Windows**
-
-
-On Microsoft Windows you have a variety of options for launching your
-application. Probably the most simple case is directly starting the Java VM
-from the command line and typing out all parameters, such as class path, the
-class name etc. In principle, this can be placed right in a shortcut and
-should work.
-
-
-A little more elegant solution is to place this in a batch file and have the
-shortcut point to this batch file. This will also make it more likely that
-users can repair or recreate shortcuts. Recreating shortcuts with
-sophisticated command lines is practically impossible.
-
-
-Another method is less commonly used but just as possible. Implement a native
-executable that launches the VM with your Java application. The VM comes as
-DLL and is used by java.exe in just the same way. As a sample look at the
-exlipse.exe provided by the `Eclipse-IDE`
-
-
-Clearly, even though the first option is a bit ugly and has some
-restrictionss, it is the most portable solution among the three.
-
-
-**Apple**
-
-
-We hope, there is a IzPack developer currently researching for the details
-for the Mac environment. We expect an updated chapter in one of the next
-releases.
-
-
-**UNIX**
-
-
-UNIX provides essentially the same options as Windows. You can simply use the
-command line option, you can write a shell script and you can write a native
-launcher. Naturally this stuff is in no way compatible with the equivalent
-Windows implementations. The native option is even more problematic in this
-environment, since the code can not even be moved from one UNIX platform to
-another, without recompilation.
-
-
-**OS Independent Launching**
-
-
-So, after all this rather discouraging news, there is actually a portable way
-to launch Java applications? You bet! although i have to admit that it is not
-necessarily the most pretty way of doing things.
-
-
-This approach is currently used by IzPack. Package your application in a
-.jar file if you don't already do so and make it executable by including the
-necessary metaINF/MANIFEST.MF information file. i am not going into all the
-details on how exactly to do this, the Java documentation will have to do.
-You might have noticed that even though the instructions to install IzPack
-say to type :
-
-::
-
-    java -jar IzPack-install.jar
-
-
-You can just as well double click on IzPack-install.jar and it will start up.
-This procedure will work on all GUI based Java supported operating systems
--though you might have to replace double clicking with dropping the file on
-the VM. In just the same way, you can make the .jar file itself the target
-of a shortcut. Note: This works only, if jars are registered as files, which
-have to launch by the installed JRE (with: javaw.exe -jar)
-
-
-The one restriction with this approach is that a .jar file can only have one
-main file. So, if you have multiple targets, they need to be packaged each
-into a different .jar file. They can be in one .jar file but then you have
-to start them explicitly, which gets you back to the problems that i
-mentioned before. This brings me to the ugly part. If you have just one
-target, then you are all set. If you have multiple targets, you need to
-create a .jar file for each of them. In addition, you have a much harder
-time setting the classpath, because each of the .jar files that contain
-supporting code must be listed. In fact, at present there is no way of
-setting this during the installation, because IzPack does not yet (version
-3.0) support the setting and modification of environment variables.
-
-
-
-Command Line
-------------
-
-Before i start to write a lot about the use of command line arguments let me
-state this: If you can avoid using them, do it! Not that there is anything
-wrong with command line arguments as such. The issue is simply that if you
-want your application to be usable cross platform (the big Java promise) you
-should shy away from using command line arguments. The problem here is that
-not all operating systems actually support command line arguments. To be more
-precise, to my knowledge only Apple operating systems do not support command
-line parameters. If you don't care for running your application on a Mac,
-then you might not worry about his at all. If you are interested to support
-the Mac as well, read on.
-
-
-In fact the Mac lower than MacOSX supports command line parameters in a way.
-More to the point, it supports a single parameter that your application
-should interpret as the name of a data file to open. You have no way of
-supplying this to your application through the command line attribute. The
-operating system generates this when the user drops the file on your
-application and then passes it as command line argument. That's it. This same
-behavior will probably fly well on pretty much any system and should
-therefore be an ok implementation.
-
-
-So what to do if you want to modify program behavior based on runtime
-switches? For one thing, you could set system properties accordingly. The
-disadvantage here is the same as with the command line parameters: the way of
-setting these might vary between operating systems. The best way seems to be
-using a property file that contains the configuration data.

-Trouble Shooting
------------------
-
-by Elmar
-
-It has been some time since i wrote this chapter during which a good number
-of users had a chance to gather experience. Unfortunately i never know how
-many have used it successfully without much difficulty. i only hear from
-those that have encountered one problem or another. The type of problems that
-i have seen prompted me to write this section, because i think it will help
-you in locating most problems that you might encounter or at least give you
-some idea where the problem might be located.
-
-
-
-Problems You Can Solve
-'''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-If you see an exception that essentially says that a library can not be
-loaded (ShellLink.dll) you have an easy problem to deal with. Your installer
-file is probably missing the native tag that adds the Windows dll to the
-installer or something with this tag is no quite right. Read 'What to Add to
-the Installer' for all details on this topic.
-
-
-Most other problems cause the ShortcutPanel not to show at all during the
-installation process. The reason is simply that the ShortcutPanel skips if it
-does not know what to do or if it has nothing to do (no point showing then
-and confusing the user). The problem is that this is not always what you
-intended. The most simple but not so uncommon case is, that the ShortcutPanel
-cannot find their spec file. This can be caused by a number of reasons. The
-associated resource tag might be missing in the installer specification file,
-the target file name might be misspelled (the name you specify for the ``id``
-attribute) or the target file name has a path or package name pre-pended. You
-have only to use ``shortcutSpec.xml`` or ``Unix_shortcutSpec.xml`` and
-nothing else, just as described in 'What to Add to the Installer'. You can
-always verify if this part is ok by inspecting the content of the installer
-.jar file. The file shortcutSpec.xml should be located in the directory
-``res``. This inspection can be performed with any zip tool. If the file is
-not there, first correct this before proceeding.
-
-
-If the file is there and the panel does not appear, you have a problem within
-the specification file. In most cases that i have seen, it comes down to a
-spelling mistake of an attribute or tag name. You just have to carefully make
-sure that everything is spelled correctly. Don't forget that all names are
-case sensitive! In a few cases it is also happend, that required or semi-
-optional attributes are omitted, so you might want to verify if all
-attributes that you need are actually supplied.
-
-
-If everything is correct up to this point the problem becomes more elusive.
-Most likely the panel will not be displayed, because it is instructed not to
-show. There are be several reasons for this. The simple case is that no
-location has been specified for the shortcuts in your installation. This can
-happen if all five location attributes are omitted or if all the ones that
-are listed are set to ``no``. Remember, you have to specify at least one
-location for every shortcut. If this is also correct, you might have used the
-``&lt;createForPack&gt;`` tag. Review the details in 'Selective Creation of
-Shortcuts'. One possibility for the panel not to show is that based on the
-packs that are currently selected for installation no shortcut qualifies for
-creation. In this case the panel will not show, this is perfectly normal
-behavior. More likely this condition is true because of some accident and not
-because it's intended. Make sure the packs that you list for the shortcut are
-actually defined in your installation and verify that they are all spelled
-correctly. Remember: case matters! Did the ShortcutPanel use to work in your
-installation and all of a sudden stopped working? Very likely you are dealing
-with the last problem. A package name might have been modified and the
-shortcut spec was not adjusted to stay in sync.
-
-
-
-Problems That Have No Solution (yet)
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Unfortunately one problem has been very persistent and only recently one user
-found the reason. The problem occurs when installing on some target systems
-where non-English characters are used in the storage path for the shortcuts.
-The problem is that these characters don't seem to be properly translated
-across the Java Native Interface. This leads to a situation where the proper
-path can not be located and the shortcut creation fails. i write 'some target
-systems' because it does not fail everywhere. After much agonizing over this
-problem, one user found the solution: The shortcut creation works fine if a
-Sun virtual machine is installed, but fails if a version from IBM happens to
-be installed. So far i have no solution for this problem but i am trying to
-find a workaround the problem.

+Desktop Shortcuts
+=================
+
+(by Elmar GROM and Marc EPPELMANN)
+
+Defining Shortcuts
+------------------
+
+
+Introduction
+'''''''''''''
+
+On todays GUI oriented operating systems, users are used to launching
+applications, view web sites, look at documentation and perform a variety of
+other tasks, by simply clicking on an icon on the desktop or in a menu system
+located on the desktop. Depending on the operating system these icons have
+different names. In this context we will refer to them collectively as
+shortcuts.
+
+
+Apart from actually placing an application on the target system, users
+routinely expect an installer to create the necessary shortcuts for the
+application as well. For you as application developer, this means that for a
+professional appearance of your product you should also consider creating
+shortcuts.
+
+
+In contrast to the general specification of an IzPack installer, the
+specification of shortcuts in IzPack requires a little more effort. In
+addition, some of the concepts are a bit more complex and there are some
+operating system specific issues to observe. Fortunately, you only need to
+worry about operating system specifics if you want to deploy your application
+to multiple different operating systems. In any case, it will pay off to
+spend some time to study this documentation and the example spec files before
+you start to implement your own shortcuts.
+
+
+At the time of writing this Chapter the current IzPack Version 3.7.0-M3 is
+only capable to creating shortcuts on
+
+1.  Microsoft Windows, and
+2.  Unix and Unix-based operating systems (like Linux), which use the
+    `X11` GUI-System and ` FreeDesktop.org` based shortcut handling (such
+    as `KDE` and `Gnome`).
+
+Other operating or GUI systems, such as MacOS X are not
+supported. However, there is a special UI-variant that automatically pops up
+on unsupported systems. It informs the user about the intended targets of
+your shortcuts and allows the user to save this information to a text file.
+While this is not an elegant solution, at least it aids the user in the
+manual creation of the shortcuts.
+
+
+If you would like to review what an end user would see if the target
+operating system is not supported, you can do the following. Simply place the
+tag ``&lt;notSupported/&gt;`` in the spec file. This tag requires no attributes or
+other data. It must be placed under ``&lt;shortcuts&gt;``, just like the individual
+shortcut specifications. Be sure to remove this tag before getting your
+application ready for shipment.
+
+
+We expect other operating systems to be supported in the near future and as
+always, contributions are very welcome. At present someone is actively
+working on Mac support.
+
+
+What to Add to the Installer
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+There are some things that you have to add to your installer to enable
+shortcut creation. Obviously you need to add the panel responsible for
+creating shortcuts. This panel is aptly enough called ShortcutPanel. However,
+in order for the ShortcutPanel to work properly a number of additional items
+are required. These must be added manually to the installer, as all other
+resourcs, since the front-end will be rewritten. In this chapter we will
+explain which of these items are required and for what reason.
+
+
+First, we would like to discuss items that are supplied with IzPack and only
+need to be added to the installer. After that, we move on to the things you
+have to prepare yourself before you can add them. The way in which shortcuts
+are created varies widely among operating systems. In some cases it is
+possible to do this with pure Java code, while other systems -such as MS-
+Windows- require native code to accomplish this task. On the other side, the
+current implementation, which creates shortcuts on Unix based systems needs
+no native library at all, since it works with 'these' pure Java code. The
+native library required for the Windows operating systems are supplied with
+IzPack is called ``ShellLink.dll``. Note: They will not be automatically
+added to your installer file. You need to list them yourself in the XML file
+for the installer. A describtion how to do this follows in the next section.
+
+
+Native libraries can be added to the installer by using the ``&lt;native&gt;`` tag.
+To add the ``ShellLink.dll``, you just have to add the following line to the
+installer XML file:
+``&lt;native type=&quot;izpack&quot; name=&quot;ShellLink.dll&quot;/&gt;``
+For more details about the use of the ``&lt;native&gt;`` tag see the chapter about
+the format of the XML file.
+
+
+You have also to add an extra specification file for each platform family to
+enable shortcut creation on these platforms. At least one (the default file)
+is required by the shortcut panel. The format of all spec files is XML and
+they must be added to the installer as a resource. The source name of this
+specification does not matter, however its resource name (also called id or
+alias) when added to the installer must be ``(prefix)+shortcutSpec.xml``.
+At this release, there are only two prefixes supported: &quot;Win&quot; for the
+Windows family and &quot;Unix&quot; for all Unixes. If the prefix is ommited the
+shortcut panel searches for a named resource: `` shortcutSpec.xml``. This is
+the default resource name. As the default resource name will be used on
+Windows platforms, the ``&quot;Win_shortcutSpec.xml&quot;`` can be ommited.
+Hint: If the shortcut panel does not find one of these named resources, it
+will never appears. So, do not use different resource names and do not add a
+path to these.
+
+ShortcutSpecs can be localized, see &quot;Localizing shortcuts&quot; below.
+

+
+
+Why use different shortcut spec files?
+
+
+1.  The Target filenames are most different.(batch files on Windows vs.
+    shell scripts on Unix.)
+2.  The Icon file formats are different. ICOs on Windows-, PNGs on Unix-
+    platforms.
+3.  The Target locations can be different.
+4.  If your installer is localized, your users sure will expect their
+    shortcuts names and descriptions to be as well. Moreover, some paths
+    can be different when OS are localized (``My Documents`` becomes
+    ``Mes Documents`` on Windows in french for example). See &quot;Localizing
+    shortcuts&quot; below.
+
+This is the simple reason.

+
+Why Native Code to do the Job on Windows?
+-----------------------------------------
+
+by Elmar
+
+
+This little chapter is not strictly part of the documentation but i have been
+asked this question sufficiently often that i think it's worth explaining
+right here. It is certainly a natural question to ask. After all IzPack is an
+application completely written in Java and primarily targeted for the
+installation of Java based programs. So why wouldn't we try to keep
+everything pure Java and avoid the use of native code altogether? There must
+be some personal preference of the developer hidden behind this approach you
+might think. Well, not really, but i admit at first it seems quite feasible
+to write it all in Java. On virtually any operating system or GUI surface
+around, Shortcuts are simply files on the local file system. Files can be
+created and accessed directly from within Java, so why should there be a need
+for using native code?
+
+
+Well, it turns out that just creating a file is not good enough, it also
+needs to have the right content. Shell Links as they are called in Windows
+land are binary files. i actually managed to find documentation on the
+format. Naturally this was hacker data, you won't get this sort of thing from
+Microsoft (by the way: thanks a lot to Jesse Hager for a smash job!). Armed
+with this information i tried to create these files myself in Java. The
+problem was that the documentation was not entirely accurate and had some
+gaps as well. i tried for over a month to get this to work but finally i had
+to give up. Even if i would have succeeded, it would have been a hack, since
+a shell link requires some information that is impossible to obtain from
+within Java. Usually you can successfully create a shell link by only filling
+in the bare minimum information and then ask Windows to resolve the link.
+Windows then repairs the shell link. Unfortunately this was only the
+beginning, soon i encountered a host of other problems. For one thing, the
+installer needs to know the correct directories for placing the links and it
+turns out they are named differently in different countries. In addition,
+there are ways of manually modifying them, which some people might actually
+have done. The only way to place the shortcut files reliably is through
+accessing the Windows Registry. Naturally, this operation also required
+native code. Same thing with asking Windows to resolve the link... On the
+bottom line, at every step and turn you run into an issue where you just need
+to use native code to do the trick. So i decided that i would do it the
+proper way all the way through. That is in a nutshell the reason why i used
+native code to create shortcuts on MS-Windows.
+
+
+As i am writing this i am at work with a friend to replicate this work for
+the Mac and it looks very much like we need to take the same approach there
+as well. On the various Unix GUIs on the other hand, we are lucky that we can
+do the job without native libraries.
+
+
+
+The Shortcut Specification
+--------------------------
+
+As we say above, the specification for shortcuts is provided to the
+ShortcutPanel in the XML fileformat. At the time of this writing (for IzPack
+version 3.7.0-M3) the front-end will be rewritten. Until these work is in
+progress you have to write the specification files manually. For your
+convenience, there are two annotated sample specification files in the sample
+subdirectory of your IzPack installation. At the beginning you might want to
+experiment with these files.
+
+
+Both specification files have one root element called ``&lt;shortcuts&gt;``. This
+root elements recognizes 3 different child elements:
+``&lt;programGroup&gt;``, ``&lt;skipIfNotSupported/&gt;`` and ``&lt;shortcut&gt;``.
+
+
+``&lt;skipIfNotSupported/&gt;`` can be used to avoid the panel to show the
+alternative UI which shows the shortcut information that would have been
+created on a system that supports it. In other words, using this tag will
+make the panel be silent on non-supported systems. The default is to show the
+alternative UI.
+
+
+The ``&lt;programGroup&gt;`` tag allows you to specify the name of the menu, or
+more precise, the folder in which the shortcuts will be grouped. The exact
+location and appearance of the program group depends on the specific target
+system on which the application will be installed, however you can partially
+control it. Please note that ``&lt;programGroup&gt;`` may only appear once in the
+specification. If more than one instance occurs, only the first one will be
+used. This tag requires two attributes: ``defaultName`` and ``location``.
+``defaultName`` specifies the name that the group menu should have on the
+target system. You should be aware that the ShortcutPanel will present this
+name to the user as a choice. The user can then edit this name or select a
+group that already exists. As a result, there is no guarantee that the actual
+name of the program group on the target system is identical with your
+specification. ``location`` specifies where the group menu should show up.
+There are two choices: ``applications`` and ``startMenu``. If you use
+``applications``, then the menu will be placed in the menu that is ordinarily
+used for application shortcuts. ``applications`` is recommended for Unix
+shortcuts. If you use ``startMenu``, the group menu will be placed at the top
+most menu level available on the target system. Depending on the target
+system, it might not be possible to honor this specification exactly. In such
+cases, the ShortcutPanel will map the choice to the location that most
+closely resembles your choice. Unix shortcuts do not need to support the
+``startMenu``, because the ``applications`` menu is already on the highest
+level. This means this has no affect on thess platform.
+
+
+For each shortcut you want to create, you have to add one ``&lt;shortcut&gt;`` tag.
+Most details about the shortcut are listed as attributes with this tag. The
+following sections describe what each attribute does, which attributes are
+optional and which ones are required and what the values are that are
+accepted for each of the attributes. Note that all attributes that have a
+yes/no choice can also be omitted. Doing so has the same effect as using a
+value of no. The shortcut attributes can be divided into two groups
+
+
+-   attributes that describe properties of the shortcut
+-   attributes that define the location(s) at which a copy of the
+    shortcut should be placed.
+
+The following attributes are used to define location:
+
+-   ``programGroup``
+-   ``desktop``
+-   ``applications``
+-   ``startMenu``
+-   ``startup``
+
+
+Shortcut Attributes
+-------------------
+
+There are three classes of attributes. Some are required, most are completely
+optional and some are semi-optional. The set of semi-optional attributes are
+all the attributes used to define the location of a shortcut. These are semi-
+optional because for any individual one it is your choice if you want to
+include it or not. However they are not completely optional. You must specify
+at least one location. If all were omitted, the instruction would essentially
+tell the panel that a copy of this shortcut is to be placed at no location.
+In other words no copy is to be placed anywhere.
+
+**name** ``- required``
+
+
+The value of this attribute defines the name that the shortcut will have.
+This is the text that makes up the menu name if the shortcut is placed in a
+menu or the caption that is displayed with the shortcut if it is placed on
+the desktop.
+
+
+**target** ``- required``
+
+
+The value of this attribute points to the application that should be launched
+when the shortcut is clicked. The value is translated through the variable
+substitutor. Therefore variables such as ``$INSTALL_PATH`` can be used to
+describe the location. **You should be aware that the use of this tag is
+likely to change once other operating systems are supported**.
+
+
+**commandLine** ``- optional``
+
+
+The value of this attribute will be passed to the application as command
+line. i recommend to work without command line arguments, since these are not
+supported by all operating systems. As a result, your applications will not
+be portable if they depend on command line arguments. Instead, consider using
+system properties or configuration files.
+
+
+**workingDirectory** ``- optional``
+
+
+This attribute defines the working directory for the application at the time
+it is launched. i would recommend some caution in relying on this too heavily
+if your application should be portable, since this might not be supported by
+all operating systems. At this time i don't have enough information to make a
+definite statement one way or the other. The value is translated through the
+variable substitutor. Therefore variables such as ``$INSTALL_PATH`` can be
+used to describe the directory.
+
+
+**description** ``- optional``
+
+
+The value of this attribute will be visible to the user when a brief
+description about associated application is requested. The form of the
+request and the way in which this description is displayed varies between
+operating systems. On MS-Windows the description is shown as a tool tip when
+the mouse cursor hovers over the icon for a few seconds. On some operating
+systems this feature might not be supported but i think it is always a good
+idea to include a brief description.
+
+
+**iconFile** ``- optional``
+
+
+The value of this attribute points to the file that holds the icon that
+should be displayed as a symbol for this shortcut. This value is also
+translated through the variable substitutor and consequently can contain
+variables such as $INSTALL_PATH. If this attribute is omitted, no icon will
+be specified for the shortcut. Usually this causes the OS to display an OS
+supplied default icon. **The use of this attribute is also likely to change
+once other operating systems are supported. Read the Section about Icons
+below, for more information.**
+
+
+**iconIndex** ``- optional``
+
+
+If the file type for the icon supports multiple icons in one file, then this
+attribute may be used to specify the correct index for the icon. i would also
+advise against using this feature, because of operating system
+incompatibilities in this area. In file formats that do not support multiple
+icons, this values is ignored.
+
+
+**initialState** ``- optional``
+
+
+There are four values accepted for this attribute: ``noShow``, ``normal``,
+``maximized`` and ``minimized``. If the target operating system supports this
+feature, then this value will have the appropriate influence on the initial
+window state of the application. ``noShow`` is particularly useful when
+launch scripts are used that cause a command window to open, because the
+command window will not be visible with this option. For instance on MS-
+Windows starting a batch file that launches a Java application has the less
+than pretty side effect that two windows show: the DOS command prompt and the
+Java application window. Even if the shortcut is configured to show
+minimized, there are buttons for both windows in the task bar. Using
+``noShow`` will completely eliminate this effect, only the Java application
+window will be visible. *On Unix use* ``normal`` *, because this is not
+supported*.
+
+
+**programGroup** ``- semi-optional``
+
+
+The value for this attribute can be either yes or no. Any other value will be
+interpreted as no. If the value is yes, then a copy of this shortcut will be
+placed in the group menu. *On Unix (KDE) this will always be placed on the
+top level.*
+
+
+**desktop** ``- semi-optional``
+
+
+For this attribute the value should also be yes or no. If the value is yes,
+then a copy of the shortcut is placed on the desktop. *On Unix the shortcuts
+will only be placed on the (KDE-) desktop of the user, who currently runs the
+installer. For Gnome the user can simply copy the *.desktop files from*
+``/Desktop`` *to* ``/gnome-desktop``. (This is already a TODO for the Unix-
+shortcut implementation.)
+
+
+**applications** ``- semi-optional``
+
+
+This is also a yes/no attribute. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
+shortcut is placed in the applications menu (if the target operating system
+supports this). This is the same location as the applications choice for the
+program group. *This makes no sense on Unix.*
+
+
+**startMenu** ``- semi-optional``
+
+
+This is a yes/no attribute as well. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
+shortcut is placed directly in the top most menu that is available for
+placing application shortcuts. *This is not supported on Unix. see above.*
+
+
+**startup** ``- semi-optional``
+
+
+This is also a yes/no attribute. If the value is yes, then a copy of the
+shortcut is placed in a location where all applications get automatically
+started at OS launch time, if this is available on the target OS. *This is
+also not supported on Unix.*
+
+
+
+Unix specific shortcut attributes
+----------------------------------
+
+This extension was programmed by MARC EPPELMANN. This is still in development
+and may be changed in one of the next releases of IzPack.
+
+
+**type** ``- required``
+
+
+This must be one of ``Application`` or ``Link``
+
+
+-   Application: To start any application, native, Java or shell-script
+    based, the **type** has to be ``Application``. The GUI-System will launch
+    this Application, so as is, thru their native shell or application
+    launcher. In this case, note that the right ``workingDirectory`` is
+    always important on Unix platforms. If the users PATH environment
+    variable does not contain the path, where the application is located,
+    this can never be run, until the ``workingDirectory`` does not contain
+    these path. The needed current path: &quot;.&quot;, this is the case on most
+    systems, should be in the users PATH environment variable. Consult the
+    Unix manuals for more details.
+-   Link: If you want to open a URL in the users default Webbrowser, you
+    have to set the **type** to ``Link``. Note: The ``url`` attribute must be
+    set to work properly.
+-   Other: There are more supported types on KDE, like FSDevice, but
+    these types makes no sense for IzPack, in my opinion.
+
+Without the type the Unix shortcut does not work.
+
+
+**url** ``- semi-optional``
+
+
+If you want to create a shortcut as type *Link*, then you have to set the
+``url`` attribute. The value can be a locally installed html or another
+document, with a known MIME type, like plain text, or a WWW Url i.e.
+'<A HREF="http://izpack.org/'.">http://izpack.org/'.</A>
+
+
+A local document can be referenced by i.e. &quot;$INSTALL_PATH/doc/index.html&quot;.
+
+
+The IzPack variable substitution system is supported by the **url**.
+
+
+**encoding** ``- required``
+
+
+This should always set to **UTF-8**.
+
+
+**terminal** ``- optional``
+
+
+If you want, the user can see the console output of a program (in Java
+applications &quot;System.outs&quot;), set the ``terminal`` attribute to **true**.
+
+
+**KdeSubstUID** ``- unused``
+
+
+This is not fully implemented by IzPack. i the future this is the sudo option
+for a shortcut.
+
+
+
+Selective Creation of Shortcuts
+-------------------------------
+
+Usually all shortcuts that are listed will be created when the user clicks
+the 'Next' button. However it is possible to control to some degree if
+specific shortcuts should be created or not. This is based on install
+conditions. By including one or more ``&lt;createForPack name=''a pack name''
+/&gt;`` tags in the specification for a shortcut, you can direct the
+ShortcutPanel to create the shortcut only if any of the listed packs are
+actually installed. The 'name' attribute is used to define the name of one of
+the packs for which the shortcut should be created. You do not need to list
+all packs if a shortcut should always be created. In this case simply omit
+this tag altogether.
+
+
+**A word of caution**
+
+
+For any shortcut that is always created, i would recommend to omit this tag,
+since i have seen a number of problems related to changing pack names. You
+can save yourself some troubleshooting and some Aspirin by not using this
+feature if it's not required. On the other hand if you need it i would advise
+to be very careful about changing pack names.
+
+
+Localizing shortcuts
+---------------------
+
+The izPack installer allows localization of your installer. Obviously, you will
+want your shortcuts labels to be localized, too. Thus, you can provide
+shortcutSpec files for each language you support.
+
+This works just like localizing other specs for other panels : add an
+underscore and the iso3 language code to the end of the resource name, and set
+the source name to the appropriate localized spec file.
+As for the platforms, if a specific spec file is not declared for the current
+language, the installer will revert to the default ``shortcutSpec.xml`` resource.
+This way, you can for example have a resource ``shortcutSpec.xml_fra`` for
+french installs and have the default resource ``shortcutSpec.xml`` (maybe
+containing strings in english) be used for other languages.
+
+The platform prefix and language suffix are combined like in this example :
+ ``Unix_shortcutSpec.xml_fra``.
+When the installer can't find such a platform-and-language-specific resource,
+it will fallback to a suitable default using the following search order :
+ ``shortcutSpec.xml_&lt;iso3&gt;`` (default platform, language-specific)
+ ``&lt;platform&gt;_shortcutSpec.xml`` (default language, platform-specific)
+ ``shortcutSpec.xml`` (default platform and language)
+
+Reminder: If the shortcut panel does not find one of these named resources,
+it will never appear. So, do not use different resource names and do not add
+a path to these.
+
+**Example**
+
+::
+	&lt;res src=&quot;C:\MyDocuments\Installer\default_shortcut_specification.xml&quot;
+     id=&quot;shortcutSpec.xml&quot;/&gt;
+	&lt;res src=&quot;C:\MyDocuments\Installer\default_shortcut_specification_fr.xml&quot;
+     id=&quot;shortcutSpec.xml_fra&quot;/&gt;
+	&lt;res src=&quot;C:\MyDocuments\Installer\unix_shortcut_specification_en.xml&quot;
+     id=&quot;Unix_shortcutSpec.xml&quot;/&gt;
+	&lt;res src=&quot;C:\MyDocuments\Installer\unix_shortcut_specification_fr.xml&quot;
+     id=&quot;Unix_shortcutSpec.xml_fra&quot;/&gt;
+
+
+DesktopShortcutCheckboxEnabled Builtin Variable
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+``$DesktopShortcutCheckboxEnabled`` : When set to true, it automatically
+checks the &quot;Create Desktop Shortcuts&quot; button. To see how to use it, go to
+`The Variables Element ``&lt;variables&gt;``
+
+Be careful this variable is case sensitve !

+
+Shortcut Tips
+-------------
+
+I wrote this section to provide additional information about issues
+surrounding the creation of shortcuts. Reading this section is not necessary
+to successfully create shortcuts, but it might help you creating an
+installation that works more smoothly. In addition, it might give you some
+knowledge about operating systems that you don't know so well. In fact most
+of the issues described in this section are focused on differences in
+operating system specifics.
+
+
+The Desktop
+'''''''''''
+
+You should recognize that the desktop is precious real estate for many
+people. They like to keep it uncluttered and keep only the things there that
+they use on a regular basis. This is not true for everybody and you might
+personally think different about this. Still, the fact remains that a lot of
+people might have different feelings about it, so you should not
+automatically assume that it is ok to place all of your shortcuts on the
+desktop proper. While your application is certainly one of the most important
+things for you, for your customers it is probably one of many applications
+they use and maybe not even the most important one. Accordingly, placing more
+shortcut icons there than they feel they will use on a regular basis and
+especially doing this without asking for permission might trigger some bad
+temper.
+
+
+Annotation: But even the experienced user should be able to organize their
+Desktop. On Linux the users desktop is the only place, which supports any
+kind of shortcuts.
+
+
+It is common practice to create a program group in the application menu
+system of the OS and place all shortcuts that go with an application in that
+program group. In addition, only one shortcut to the key access point of the
+application is placed directly on the desktop. Many installers first ask for
+permission to do so, as does the ShortcutPanel in IzPack.
+
+
+I would like to recommend that you always create a shortcut in the menu
+system, even if your application has only one access point and you are
+placing this on the desktop. Note that shortcuts can also be placed directly
+in the menu, they don't need to be in a program group. There are two reasons
+for doing so.
+
+
+-   If the user elects not to create shortcuts on the desktop, they will
+    end up with no access point to your application
+-   Even if this works fine, occasionally people 'clean up' their
+    desktop. They might later find that they accidentally deleted the only
+    access point to your application. For the less technology savvy users,
+    recreating the shortcut might be a rough experience.
+
+
+Icons
+''''''
+
+Icons are supplied in image files, usually in some kind of bitmap format.
+Unfortunately there is no format that is universally recognized by all
+operating systems. If you would like to create shortcuts on a variety of
+operating systems that use your own icons, you must supply each icon in a
+number of different formats. This chapter discusses icon file formats used on
+various operating systems. Fortunately there are good programs available that
+allow you to convert between these formats, so that creating the different
+files is not much of a problem once the icons themselves are created.
+
+
+**Microsoft Windows**
+
+
+Windows prefers to use its native icon file format. Files of this type
+usually use the extension .ico. These so called ICO files can hold multiple
+icons in one file, which can be useful if the same icon is to be provided in
+a number of sizes and color-depths.
+
+Windows itself selects the icon with the most matching dimensions and
+displays it. While the Start menu displays the icon with 16x16 pixel if
+available, the desktop displays the 32x32 pixel resolution of the same ICO if
+this is in.
+
+In other words, a ICO file has embedded one or more dimensions of the same
+Icon. We recommend to play with `microangelo`.
+
+Dlls and Exe files on the other side, can store, amongst other things, a
+collection of different Icons. You can select your desired Icon by its index.
+The lowest index is 0. Use the iconIndex attribute in the spec file to
+specify this index.
+
+
+As a sample look into
+
+::
+
+    %SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll
+
+
+These contains a lot of Windows own icons. You can use the `PE Explorer` or
+another Resource Editor to extract or modify Icons in dlls or exe files. But
+be warned. You can also destroy a working application with these kind of
+tools.
+
+At least Windows also supports the use of bitmap files in the .bmp format as
+icons. Note that this format does not support multiple icons.
+
+
+We might have overlooked other file formats that are supported by Windows.
+However, we suggest to test other formats for compatibility as they might not
+work all the way back to Windows 95 or on the NT/non-NT strain. Sticking with
+one of these two formats should keep you out of trouble.
+
+
+**Apple**
+
+
+Apple Macintosh systems use the Macintosh PICT format, extension .pct. If
+you are working with an apple system you know a whole lot more about this
+format than i do. If you don't but would like to be able to install your
+application on a Mac, simply start with any bitmap format that you feel
+comfortable to work with. Then find an application that is capable of
+converting this format into a .pct file. i like to use Paint Shop Pro (PC
+based), because it provides conversion capabilities among several dozen
+different file formats.
+
+
+**UNIX flavors**
+
+
+by Marc Eppelmann
+
+
+As my knowledge, all X based Unix Window systems supports the (ASCII-) XBM
+(X-Bitmap ) and the better XPM (X-PixMap) format. The modern GUI systems like
+KDE and Gnome can display additionally a lot of other ImageIcon formats, such
+as GIF, JPG, and PNG.
+
+
+i suggest to use PNG, because this can lossless compress like the GIF format,
+however this format is absolutely free. And not least, this can store true
+transparency informations (It has an alpha channel).
+
+
+Targets
+''''''''
+
+So, you thought you could escape the ugly mess of operating system
+dependencies at least with the way how your Java application is started?
+Sorry but i have just another bad message. The one positive thing is that
+here you have a way of escaping, even if doing so has a few less pretty side
+effects. At first, i would like to discuss various launching options you have
+available on different operating systems. At the end of the chapter i write
+about a way to make launching your application OS independent.
+
+
+**Microsoft Windows**
+
+
+On Microsoft Windows you have a variety of options for launching your
+application. Probably the most simple case is directly starting the Java VM
+from the command line and typing out all parameters, such as class path, the
+class name etc. In principle, this can be placed right in a shortcut and
+should work.
+
+
+A little more elegant solution is to place this in a batch file and have the
+shortcut point to this batch file. This will also make it more likely that
+users can repair or recreate shortcuts. Recreating shortcuts with
+sophisticated command lines is practically impossible.
+
+
+Another method is less commonly used but just as possible. Implement a native
+executable that launches the VM with your Java application. The VM comes as
+DLL and is used by java.exe in just the same way. As a sample look at the
+exlipse.exe provided by the `Eclipse-IDE`
+
+
+Clearly, even though the first option is a bit ugly and has some
+restrictionss, it is the most portable solution among the three.
+
+
+**Apple**
+
+
+We hope, there is a IzPack developer currently researching for the details
+for the Mac environment. We expect an updated chapter in one of the next
+releases.
+
+
+**UNIX**
+
+
+UNIX provides essentially the same options as Windows. You can simply use the
+command line option, you can write a shell script and you can write a native
+launcher. Naturally this stuff is in no way compatible with the equivalent
+Windows implementations. The native option is even more problematic in this
+environment, since the code can not even be moved from one UNIX platform to
+another, without recompilation.
+
+
+**OS Independent Launching**
+
+
+So, after all this rather discouraging news, there is actually a portable way
+to launch Java applications? You bet! although i have to admit that it is not
+necessarily the most pretty way of doing things.
+
+
+This approach is currently used by IzPack. Package your application in a
+.jar file if you don't already do so and make it executable by including the
+necessary metaINF/MANIFEST.MF information file. i am not going into all the
+details on how exactly to do this, the Java documentation will have to do.
+You might have noticed that even though the instructions to install IzPack
+say to type :
+
+::
+
+    java -jar IzPack-install.jar
+
+
+You can just as well double click on IzPack-install.jar and it will start up.
+This procedure will work on all GUI based Java supported operating systems
+-though you might have to replace double clicking with dropping the file on
+the VM. In just the same way, you can make the .jar file itself the target
+of a shortcut. Note: This works only, if jars are registered as files, which
+have to launch by the installed JRE (with: javaw.exe -jar)
+
+
+The one restriction with this approach is that a .jar file can only have one
+main file. So, if you have multiple targets, they need to be packaged each
+into a different .jar file. They can be in one .jar file but then you have
+to start them explicitly, which gets you back to the problems that i
+mentioned before. This brings me to the ugly part. If you have just one
+target, then you are all set. If you have multiple targets, you need to
+create a .jar file for each of them. In addition, you have a much harder
+time setting the classpath, because each of the .jar files that contain
+supporting code must be listed. In fact, at present there is no way of
+setting this during the installation, because IzPack does not yet (version
+3.0) support the setting and modification of environment variables.
+
+
+
+Command Line
+------------
+
+Before i start to write a lot about the use of command line arguments let me
+state this: If you can avoid using them, do it! Not that there is anything
+wrong with command line arguments as such. The issue is simply that if you
+want your application to be usable cross platform (the big Java promise) you
+should shy away from using command line arguments. The problem here is that
+not all operating systems actually support command line arguments. To be more
+precise, to my knowledge only Apple operating systems do not support command
+line parameters. If you don't care for running your application on a Mac,
+then you might not worry about his at all. If you are interested to support
+the Mac as well, read on.
+
+
+In fact the Mac lower than MacOSX supports command line parameters in a way.
+More to the point, it supports a single parameter that your application
+should interpret as the name of a data file to open. You have no way of
+supplying this to your application through the command line attribute. The
+operating system generates this when the user drops the file on your
+application and then passes it as command line argument. That's it. This same
+behavior will probably fly well on pretty much any system and should
+therefore be an ok implementation.
+
+
+So what to do if you want to modify program behavior based on runtime
+switches? For one thing, you could set system properties accordingly. The
+disadvantage here is the same as with the command line parameters: the way of
+setting these might vary between operating systems. The best way seems to be
+using a property file that contains the configuration data.
+
+
+
+Trouble Shooting
+-----------------
+
+by Elmar
+
+It has been some time since i wrote this chapter during which a good number
+of users had a chance to gather experience. Unfortunately i never know how
+many have used it successfully without much difficulty. i only hear from
+those that have encountered one problem or another. The type of problems that
+i have seen prompted me to write this section, because i think it will help
+you in locating most problems that you might encounter or at least give you
+some idea where the problem might be located.
+
+
+
+Problems You Can Solve
+'''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+If you see an exception that essentially says that a library can not be
+loaded (ShellLink.dll) you have an easy problem to deal with. Your installer
+file is probably missing the native tag that adds the Windows dll to the
+installer or something with this tag is no quite right. Read 'What to Add to
+the Installer' for all details on this topic.
+
+
+Most other problems cause the ShortcutPanel not to show at all during the
+installation process. The reason is simply that the ShortcutPanel skips if it
+does not know what to do or if it has nothing to do (no point showing then
+and confusing the user). The problem is that this is not always what you
+intended. The most simple but not so uncommon case is, that the ShortcutPanel
+cannot find their spec file. This can be caused by a number of reasons. The
+associated resource tag might be missing in the installer specification file,
+the target file name might be misspelled (the name you specify for the ``id``
+attribute) or the target file name has a path or package name pre-pended. You
+have only to use ``shortcutSpec.xml`` or ``Unix_shortcutSpec.xml`` and
+nothing else, just as described in 'What to Add to the Installer'. You can
+always verify if this part is ok by inspecting the content of the installer
+.jar file. The file shortcutSpec.xml should be located in the directory
+``res``. This inspection can be performed with any zip tool. If the file is
+not there, first correct this before proceeding.
+
+
+If the file is there and the panel does not appear, you have a problem within
+the specification file. In most cases that i have seen, it comes down to a
+spelling mistake of an attribute or tag name. You just have to carefully make
+sure that everything is spelled correctly. Don't forget that all names are
+case sensitive! In a few cases it is also happend, that required or semi-
+optional attributes are omitted, so you might want to verify if all
+attributes that you need are actually supplied.
+
+
+If everything is correct up to this point the problem becomes more elusive.
+Most likely the panel will not be displayed, because it is instructed not to
+show. There are be several reasons for this. The simple case is that no
+location has been specified for the shortcuts in your installation. This can
+happen if all five location attributes are omitted or if all the ones that
+are listed are set to ``no``. Remember, you have to specify at least one
+location for every shortcut. If this is also correct, you might have used the
+``&lt;createForPack&gt;`` tag. Review the details in 'Selective Creation of
+Shortcuts'. One possibility for the panel not to show is that based on the
+packs that are currently selected for installation no shortcut qualifies for
+creation. In this case the panel will not show, this is perfectly normal
+behavior. More likely this condition is true because of some accident and not
+because it's intended. Make sure the packs that you list for the shortcut are
+actually defined in your installation and verify that they are all spelled
+correctly. Remember: case matters! Did the ShortcutPanel use to work in your
+installation and all of a sudden stopped working? Very likely you are dealing
+with the last problem. A package name might have been modified and the
+shortcut spec was not adjusted to stay in sync.
+
+
+
+Problems That Have No Solution (yet)
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Unfortunately one problem has been very persistent and only recently one user
+found the reason. The problem occurs when installing on some target systems
+where non-English characters are used in the storage path for the shortcuts.
+The problem is that these characters don't seem to be properly translated
+across the Java Native Interface. This leads to a situation where the proper
+path can not be located and the shortcut creation fails. i write 'some target
+systems' because it does not fail everywhere. After much agonizing over this
+problem, one user found the solution: The shortcut creation works fine if a
+Sun virtual machine is installed, but fails if a version from IBM happens to
+be installed. So far i have no solution for this problem but i am trying to
+find a workaround the problem.

-Writing Installation XML Files
-==============================
-
-
-What You Need
--------------
-
-
-Your editor
-'''''''''''
-
-In order to write your XML installation files, you just need a plain text
-editor. Of course it's always easier to work with color coded text, so you
-might rather want to work with a text editor having such a feature. Here is a
-list of free editors that work well :
-
--   Jext : <A HREF="http://www.jext.org/">http://www.jext.org/</A>
--   JEdit : <A HREF="http://www.jedit.org/">http://www.jedit.org/</A>
--   classics like Vim and (X)Emacs.
-
-If you are a developer and tend to write your own patches, extension or
-features to IzPack sources, or, if you wish to debug your compilation,
-installation and uninstallation, we recommend these IDE:
-
--   IntelliJ IDEA : <A HREF="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</A>
--   Eclipse : <A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org/</A>
--   Netbeans : <A HREF="http://www.netbeans.org/">http://www.netbeans.org/</A>
-
-For the first one, JetBrains has granted us an Open Source License. All
-project members can ask the Licence Key to one of the project manager.
-
-The other ones are well know open source projects (Just like us :-)). We provide
-a tutorial on how to develop/debug IzPack using Eclipse in the chapter
-''Getting Started &gt; How to develop and debug IpPack using Eclipse''
-
-
-Writing XML
-'''''''''''
-
-Though you might not know much about XML, you have certainly heard about it.
-If you know XML you can skip this subsection as we will briefly present how
-to use XML.
-
-
-XML is a markup language, really close to HTML. If you've ever worked with
-HTML the transition will be fast. However there are a few little things to
-know. The markups used in XML have the following form : ``&lt;markup&gt;``. Each
-markup has to be closed somewhere with its ending tag : ``&lt;/markup&gt;``. Each
-tag can contain text and other markups. If a markup does not contain
-anything, it is just reported once : ``&lt;markup/&gt;``. A markup can contain
-attributes like : ``&lt;markup attr1=&quot;123&quot; attr2=&quot;hello !&quot;/&gt;``. Here is a sample
-of a valid XML structure :
-
-::
-
-    &lt;chapter title=&quot;Chapter 1&quot;&gt;
-      &lt;section name=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt;
-        &lt;paragraph&gt;
-        This is the text of the paragraph number 1. It is available
-        for the very low
-        price of &lt;price currency=&quot;dollar&quot;&gt;1 000 000&lt;/price&gt;.
-        &lt;/paragraph&gt;
-      &lt;/section&gt;
-      &lt;section name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;
-      xxx
-      &lt;/section&gt;
-    &lt;/chapter&gt;
-
-
-You should be aware of the following common mistakes :
-
--   markups **are** case sensitive : ``&lt;markup&gt;`` is different from
-    ``&lt;Markup&gt;``.
--   you **must** close the markups in the same order as you create them :
-    ``&lt;m1&gt;&lt;m2&gt;(...)&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/m1&gt;`` is right but `` &lt;m1&gt;&lt;m2&gt;(...)&lt;/m1&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;`` is
-    not.
-
-Also, an XML file must start with the following header :
-``&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1 standalone=&quot;yes&quot; ?&gt;``. The only
-thing you should modify is the encoding (put here the one your text editor
-saves your files to). The `` standalone`` attribute is not very important for
-us.
-
-
-This (brief !) introduction to XML was just meant to enable you to write your
-installation specification. For a better introduction there are plenty of
-books and articles/tutorials dealing with XML on the Internet, in book
-stores, in magazines and so on.
-
-Variable Substitution
----------------------
-
-During the installation process IzPack can substitute variables in various
-places with real values. Obvious targets for variable substitution are
-resource files and launch scripts, however you will notice many more places
-where it is more powerful to use variables rather then hard coded values.
-Wherever variables can be used it will be explained in the documentation.
-
-
-There are three types of variables:
-
--   Built-In variables. These are implemented in IzPack and are all
-    dynamic in nature. This means that the value of each variable depends on
-    local conditions on the target system.
--   Environment variables. These are provided by the operating system the
-    installer is run on.
--   Variables that you can define. You also define the value, which is
-    fixed for a given installation file.
-
-You define your own variables in the installation XML file with the
-``&lt;variable&gt;`` tag. How to do this is explained in detail later in this
-chapter.
-
-
-**Please note** that when using variables they must always appear with a
-'``$``' sign as the first character, even though they are not defined this
-way.
-
-
-
-The Built-In Variables
-----------------------
-
-The following variables are built-in :
-
--   ``$INSTALL_PATH`` : the installation path on the target system, as
-    chosen by the user
--   ``$APPLICATIONS_DEFAULT_ROOT`` : the default path for applications
--   ``$JAVA_HOME`` : the JavaTM virtual machine home path
--   ``$CLASS_PATH`` : the Class Path used mainly for Java Applications
--   ``$USER_HOME`` : the user's home directory path
--   ``$USER_name`` : the user name
--   ``$APP_name`` : the application name
--   ``$APP_URL`` : the application URL
--   ``$APP_VER`` : the application version
--   ``$ISO3_LANG`` : the ISO3 language code of the selected langpack.
--   ``$IP_ADDRESS`` : the IP Address of the local machine.
--   ``$HOST_NAME`` : the HostName of the local machine.
--   ``$FILE_SEPARATOR`` : the file separator on the installation system
--   ``$DesktopShortcutCheckboxEnabled`` : When set to true, it
-    automatically checks the &quot;Create Desktop Shortcuts&quot; button. To see how to
-    use it, go to `The Variables Element ``&lt;variables&gt;`` Be careful this
-    variable is case sensitve !
--   ``$InstallerFrame.logfilePath`` : The path to the install log. This
-    file contains the paths of all installed files. If set to &quot;default&quot; then
-    the &quot;$INSTALL_PATH/Uninstaller/install.log&quot; path will be used. To see how
-    to use it, go to `The Variables Element ``&lt;variables&gt;``. If this
-    variable is not set, no install.log will be created.
-
-
-Environment Variables
----------------------
-
-Environment variables can be accessed via the syntax ``${ENV[variable]}``.
-The curly braces are mandatory. Note that variable names are case-sensitive
-and usually in UPPER CASE.
-
-Example: To get the value of the OS environment variable &quot;CATALINA_HOME&quot;, use
-``${ENV[CATALINA_HOME]}``.
-
-
-Parse Types
------------
-
-Parse types apply only when replacing variables in text files. At places
-where it might be necessary to specify a parse type, the documentation will
-mention this. Depending on the parse type, IzPack will handle special cases
--such as escaping control characters- correctly. The following parse types
-are available:
-
--   ``plain`` - use this type for plain text files, where no special
-    substitution rules apply. All variables will be replaced with their
-    respective values as is.
--   ``javaprop`` - use this type if the substitution happens in a Java
-    properties file. Individual variables might be modified to function
-    properly within the context of Java property files.
--   ``xml`` - use this type if the substitution happens in a XML file.
-    Individual variables might be modified to function properly within the
-    context of XML files.
--   ``shell`` - use this type if the substitution happens in a shell
-    script. Because shell scripts use ``$variable`` themselves, an
-    alternative variable marker is used: ``%variable`` or ``%{variable}``.
-
-
-The IzPack Elements
--------------------
-
-*When writing your installer XML files, it's a good idea to have a look at
-the iZPACK installation DTD*.
-
-
-
-
-The Root Element ``&lt;installation&gt;``
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-The root element of an installation is ``&lt;installation&gt;``. It takes one
-required attribute : ``version``. The attribute defines the version of the
-XML file layout and is used by the compiler to identify if it is compatible
-with the XML file. This should be set to **1.0** for the moment.
-
-
-The Information Element ``&lt;info&gt;``
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This element is used to specify some general information for the installer.
-It contains the following elements :
-
--   ``&lt;appname&gt;`` : the application name
--   ``&lt;appversion&gt;`` : the application version
--   ``&lt;appsubpath&gt;`` : the subpath for the default of the installation
-    path. A variable substitution and a maskable slash-backslash conversion
-    will be done. If this tag is not defined, the application name will be
-    used instead.
--   ``&lt;url&gt;`` : the application official website url
--   ``&lt;authors&gt;`` : specifies the author(s) of the application. It must
-    contain at least one ``&lt;author&gt;`` element whose attributes are :
-
-    -   ``name`` : the author's name
-    -   ``email`` : the author's email
-
--   ``&lt;uninstaller&gt;`` : specifies whether to create an uninstaller after
-    installation, and which name to use for it. This tag has the ``write``
-    attribute, with default value `` yes``. If this tag is not specified, the
-    uninstaller will still be written. The ``name`` attribute can be used to
-    change the default name of the generated uninstaller, *i.e.* ``
-    uninstaller.jar``.
--   ``&lt;javaversion&gt;`` : specifies the minimum version of Java required to
-    install your program. Values can be ``1.2``, ``1.2.2``, ``1.4``, etc. The
-    test is a lexical comparison against the ``java.version`` System property
-    on the install machine.
--   ``&lt;webdir&gt;`` : Causes a ''web installer'' to be created, and
-    specifies the URL packages are retrieved from at install time. The
-    content of the tag must be a properly formed URL.
--   ``&lt;summarylogfilepath&gt;`` : specifies the path for the logfile of the
-    `SummaryLoggerInstallerListener`.
-
-Here is an example of a typical ``&lt;info&gt;`` section :
-
-
-::
-
-    &lt;info&gt;
-      &lt;appname&gt;Super extractor&lt;/appname&gt;
-      &lt;appversion&gt;2.1 beta 6&lt;/appversion&gt;
-      &lt;appsubpath&gt;myCompany/SExtractor&lt;/appsubpath&gt;
-      &lt;url&gt;<A HREF="http://www.superextractor.com/&lt;/url">http://www.superextractor.com/&lt;/url</A>&gt;
-      &lt;authors&gt;
-        &lt;author name=&quot;John John Doo&quot; email=&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/izpack-changes">jjd at jjd-mail.com</A>&quot;/&gt;
-        &lt;author name=&quot;El Goyo&quot; email=&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/izpack-changes">goyoman at mymail.org</A>&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;/authors&gt;
-      &lt;javaversion&gt;1.2&lt;/javaversion&gt;
-    &lt;/info&gt;
-
-The Packaging Element ``&lt;packaging&gt;``
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This element allows to specify packaging options. If not specified, the default will be to create an all in one
-installer. This element will usually be used to create an installer which spans over multiple volumes, 
-e.g. the output will be two CDs. The packaging-element contains the following elements:
-
--   ``&lt;packager&gt;`` : specifies options used by the packager. The packager tag has the ``class`` attribute,
-    which specifys the class to use for packaging. Currently two implementations
-    are available (com.izforge.izpack.compiler.Packager, com.izforge.izpack.compiler.MultiVolumePackager).
-    The packager-element can contain the ``&lt;options&gt;`` element which can have different attributes for the different
-    implementations of packagers. For the MultiVolumePackager, it can have the following attributes:
-    
-    -	``volumesize``: the size of the volumes
-    -	``firstvolumefreespace``: free space on the first volume used for the installer jar and additional resources like
-    	readme-files etc.
-    
-    
--   ``&lt;unpacker&gt;`` : specifies which unpacker class should be used. Currently there are two unpacker implementations
-	(com.izforge.izpack.compiler.UnPacker, com.izforge.izpack.compiler.MultiVolumeUnPacker).
-  
-Here's an example how to specify an installer which will create multiple volumes. In this example the volumes shall be
-CDs with 650 megabytes. There will be an additional free space of 150 megabytes on the first volume. This will result in
-the creation of an installer.jar and multiple installer.pak* files. The installer.jar plus installer.pak plus the additional
-resources have to be copied on the first volume, each installer.pak.&lt;number&gt; on several volumes. 
-  
-::
-
- 	  &lt;packaging&gt;
-	    &lt;packager class=&quot;com.izforge.izpack.compiler.MultiVolumePackager&quot;&gt;
-			&lt;!-- 650 MB volumes, 150 MB space on the first volume --&gt;
-	        &lt;options volumesize=&quot;681574400&quot; firstvolumefreespace=&quot;157286400&quot;/&gt;
-	    &lt;/packager&gt;
-	    &lt;unpacker class=&quot;com.izforge.izpack.installer.MultiVolumeUnpacker&quot; /&gt;
-	  &lt;/packaging&gt;
-
-The Variables Element ``&lt;variables&gt;``
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This element allows you to define variables for the variables substitution
-system. Some variables are built-in, such as ``$INSTALL_PATH`` (which is the
-installation path chosen by the user). When you define a set of variables,
-you just have to place as many ``&lt;variable&gt;`` tags in the file as needed. If
-you define a variable named ``VERSION`` you need to type $VERSION in the
-files to parse. The variable substitutor will then replace it with the
-correct value. One ``&lt;variable&gt;`` tag take the following attributes :
-
--   ``name`` : the variable name
--   ``value`` : the variable value
-
-Here's a sample ``&lt;variables&gt;`` section :
-
-
-::
-
-    &lt;variables&gt;
-      &lt;variable name=&quot;app-version&quot; value=&quot;1.4&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;variable name=&quot;released-on&quot; value=&quot;08/03/2002&quot;/&gt;
-    &lt;/variables&gt;
-
-
-Here's a precise sample on how to use desktopshortcutcheckboxenabled and
-InstallerFrame.logfilePath variables:
-
-
-::
-
-    &lt;variables&gt;
-      &lt;variable name=&quot;InstallerFrame.logfilePath&quot; value=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH
-      /My-install.log&quot;/&gt;
-        &lt;!-- This means that the log name will be My-install and that
-      it will be stored at the root of the installation. --&gt;
-        &lt;!-- Any path is fine. If value is set to &quot;Default&quot; then
-      &quot;$INSTALL_PATH/uninstall/install.log&quot; is used. --&gt;
-        &lt;!-- And if variable isn't defined then no log is written. --&gt;
-      &lt;variable name=&quot;desktopshortcutcheckboxenabled&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
-        &lt;!-- This automatically checks the &quot;Create Desktop Shortcuts&quot;
-      button. Default value is &quot;False&quot;. --&gt;
-    &lt;/variables&gt;
-
-
-The GUI Preferences Element ``&lt;guiprefs&gt;``
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This element allows you to set the behavior of your installer GUI. This
-information will not have any effect on the command-line installers that will
-be available in future versions of iZPACK . The arguments to specify are :
-
--   ``resizable`` : takes ``yes`` or ``no`` and indicates whether the
-    window size can be changed or not.
--   ``width`` : sets the initial window width
--   ``height`` : sets the initial window height.
-
-Here's a sample :
-
-::
-
-    &lt;guiprefs resizable=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;
-
-
-Starting from IzPack 3.6, the look and feel can be specified in this section
-on a per-OS basis. For instance you can use the native look and feels on
-Win32 and OS X but use a third-party one on Unix-like platforms. To do that,
-you have to add some children to the ``guiprefs`` tag:
-
--   ``laf``: the tag that specifies a look and feel. It has a ``name``
-    parameter that defines the look and feel name.
--   Each ``laf`` element needs at least one ``os`` tag, specified like in
-    the other parts of the specification that support this tag.
--   Like you can add ``os`` elements, you can add any number of ``param``
-    elements to customize a look and feel. A ``param`` elements has two
-    attribues: ``name`` and `` value``.
-
-The available look and feels are:
-
--   Kunststoff: ``kunststoff``
--   Liquid: ``liquid``
--   Metouia: ``metouia``
--   JGoodies Looks: ``looks``
--   Substance: ``substance``
-
-If you don't specify a look and feel for a particular operating system, then
-the default native one will be used: Windows on Windows, Aqua on Mac OS X and
-Metal on the Unix-like variants.
-
-
-The *Liquid Look and Feel* supports the following parameters:
-
--   ``decorate.frames``: ``yes`` means that it will render the frames in
-    Liquid style
--   ``decorate.dialogs``: ``yes`` means that it will render the dialogs
-    in Liquid style
-
-The *JGoodies Looks* look and feel can be specified by using the ``variant``
-parameters. The values can be one of:
-
--   ``windows``: use the Windows look
--   ``plastic``: use the basic Plastic look
--   ``plastic3D``: use the Plastic 3D look
--   ``plasticXP``: use the Plastic XP look (default).
-
-Here is a small sample:
-
-::
-
-    &lt;guiprefs height=&quot;600&quot; resizable=&quot;yes&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;
-        &lt;laf name=&quot;metouia&quot;&gt;
-            &lt;os family=&quot;unix&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;/laf&gt;
-        &lt;laf name=&quot;looks&quot;&gt;
-            &lt;os family=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;
-            &lt;param name=&quot;variant&quot; value=&quot;extwin&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;/laf&gt;
-    &lt;/guiprefs&gt;
-
-
-The *Substance* look and feel *toned-down* themes can be specified using the
-``variant`` parameter, with the value being one of: ``business, business-
-blue, business-black, creme, sahara, moderate, officesilver``. We have
-reduced the choice to the toned-down themes since they are the only ones to
-actually look decent (the other families colors are way too saturated).
-Please consult <A HREF="https://substance.dev.java.net/docs/skins/toneddown.html">https://substance.dev.java.net/docs/skins/toneddown.html</A>
-for a gallery of the different toned-down themes.
-
-Starting from IzPack 3.7, some characteristics can be customized with the
-``&lt;modifier&gt;`` tag. There is a separate description in the `Advanced
-Features` chapter paragraph `Modifying the GUI`.
-
-
-
-The Localization Element ``&lt;locale&gt;``
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This element is used to specify the language packs (langpacks) that you want
-to use for your installer. You must set one ``&lt;langpack&gt;`` markup per
-language. This markup takes the `` iso3`` parameter which specifies the iso3
-language code.
-
-
-Here's a sample :
-
-
-::
-
-    &lt;locale&gt;
-      &lt;langpack iso3=&quot;eng&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;langpack iso3=&quot;fra&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;langpack iso3=&quot;spa&quot;/&gt;
-    &lt;/locale&gt;
-
-
-The supported ISO3 codes are :
-
-========= ============================
-ISO3 code Language
-========= ============================
-cat       Catalunyan
-chn       Chinese
-cze       Czech

-fin       Finnish
-fra       French

-The Resources Element ``&lt;resources&gt;``
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Several panels, such as the license panel and the shortcut panel, require
-additional data to perform their task. This data is supplied in the form of
-resources. This section describes how to specify them. Take a look at each
-panel description to see if it might need any resources. Currently, no checks
-are made to ensure resources needed by any panel have been included. The ``
-&lt;resources&gt;`` element is not required, and no ``&lt;res&gt;`` elements are required
-within.
-The ``&lt;resources&gt;`` element is the only element besides the ``&lt;packs&gt;``
-element that is taken into consideration in referenced pack-files (see
-```&lt;packs&gt;`` element`_ for more info)
-
-
-You have to set one ``&lt;res&gt;`` markup for each resource. Here are the
-attributes to specify :
-
--   ``src`` : the path to the resource file which can be named freely of
-    course (for instance ``my-picture.jpg``).
--   ``id`` : the resource id, depending on the needs of a particular
-    panel
--   ``parse`` : takes ``yes`` or ``no`` (default is ``no``) - used to
-    specify whether the resource must be parsed at the installer compilation
-    time. For instance you could set the application version in a readme file
-    used by ``InfoPanel``.
--   ``type`` : specifies the parse type. This makes sense only for a text
-    resource - the default is ``plain``, other values are ``javaprop, xml``
-    (Java properties file and XML files)
--   ``encoding`` : specifies the resource encoding if the receiver needs
-    to know. This makes sense only for a text resource.
-
-Here's a sample :
-
-::
-
-    &lt;resources&gt;
-      &lt;res id=&quot;InfoPanel.info&quot; src=&quot;doc/readme.txt&quot; parse=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;res id=&quot;LicencePanel.licence&quot; src=&quot;legal/License.txt&quot;/&gt;
-    &lt;/resources&gt;
-
-
-The Panels Element ``&lt;panels&gt;``
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Here you tell the compiler which panels you want to use. They will appear in
-the installer in the order in which they are listed in your XML installation
-file. Take a look at the different panels in order to find the ones you need.
-The ``&lt;panel&gt;`` markup takes a single attribute ``classname`` which is the
-classname of the panel.
-
-
-Here's a sample :
-
-::
-
-    &lt;panels&gt;
-      &lt;panel classname=&quot;HelloPanel&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;panel classname=&quot;LicencePanel&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;panel classname=&quot;TargetPanel&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;panel classname=&quot;InstallPanel&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;panel classname=&quot;FinishPanel&quot;/&gt;
-    &lt;/panels&gt;
-
-
-The Packs Element ``&lt;packs&gt;``
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This is a crucial section as it is used to specify the files that need to be
-installed. The ``&lt;packs&gt;`` section consists of several ``&lt;pack&gt;`` and
-``&lt;refpack&gt;`` tags.
-
-The ``&lt;pack&gt;`` takes the following attributes :
-
--   ``name``: the pack name
--   ``required``: takes ``yes`` or ``no`` and specifies whether the pack
-    is optional or not.
--   ``os``: optional attribute that lets you make the pack targeted to a
-    specific *operating system*, for instance ``unix``, ``mac`` and so on.
--   ``preselected``: optional attribute that lets you choose whether the
-    pack is by default selected for installation or not. Possible values are
-    ``yes`` and ``no``. A pack which is not preselected needs to be
-    explicitly selected by the user during installation to get installed.
--   ``loose``: can be used so that the files are not located in the
-    installer Jar. The possible values are ``true`` or ``false``, the default
-    beeing ``false``. The author of this feature needed to put his
-    application on a CD so that the users could run it directly from this
-    media. However, he also wanted to offer them the possibility to install
-    the software localy. Enabling this feature will make IzPack take the
-    files on disk instead of from the installer. *Please make sure that your
-    relative files paths are correct !*
--   ``id``: this attribute is used to give a unique id to the pack to be
-    used for internationalization.
--   ``packImgId``: this attribute is used to reference a unique resource
-    that represents the pack's image for the ImgPacksPanel. The resource
-    should be defined in the ``&lt;resources&gt;`` element of the installation XML
-    using the same value for the ``id`` attribute of the ``&lt;res&gt;`` element.
-
-The ``&lt;refpack&gt;`` takes only one attribute ``file``, which contains the
-relative path (from the installation compiler) to an externally defined
-packs-definition. This external packs definition is a regular IzPack
-installation XML. However the only elements that are used from that XML file
-are the ``&lt;packs&gt;`` and the ``&lt;resources&gt;`` elements. This enables a model in
-which a single developer is responsible for maintaining the packs and
-resources related to the development-package assigned to him. The main
-install XML references these xml-files to avoid synchronization efforts
-between the central installation XML and the developer-maintained installer
-XMLs.
-
-Internationalization of the PacksPanel
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-In order to provide internationalization for the PacksPanel, so that your
-users can be presented with a different name and description for each
-language you support, you have to create a file named ``packsLang.xml_xyz``
-where ``xyz`` is the ISO3 code of the language in lowercase. Please be aware
-that case is significant. This file has to be inserted in the resources
-section of `` install.xml`` with the ``id`` and ``src`` attributes set at the
-name of the file. The format of these files is identical with the
-distribution langpack files located at ``
-$IZPACK_HOME/bin/langpacks/installer``. For the name of the panel you just
-use the pack ``id`` as the txt ``id``. For the description you use the pack
-``id`` suffixed with ``.description``.
-
-The following sections describe the tags available for a ``&lt;pack&gt;`` section.
-
-
-``&lt;description&gt;`` - pack description
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-The contents of the ``&lt;description&gt;`` tag describe the pack contents. This
-description is displayed if the user highlights the pack during installation.
-
-
-``&lt;depends&gt;`` - pack dependencies
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This can be used to make this pack selectable only to be installed only if
-some other is selected to be installed. The pack can depend on more than one
-by specifying more than one `` &lt;depends&gt;`` elements.
-Circular depedencies are not supported and the compiler reports an error if
-one occurs.
-
-This tag takes the following attribute:
-
--   ``packname``: The name of the pack that it depends on
-
-
-``&lt;os&gt;`` - OS restrictions
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-It is possible to restrict a panel to a certain list of operating systems.
-This tag takes the following attributes:
-
--   ``family``: unix, windows or mac
--   ``name``: the exact OS name (ie Windows, Linux, ...)
--   ``version``: the exact OS version (see the JVM ``os.version``
-    property)
--   ``arch``: the machine architecture (see the JVM ``os.arch``
-    property).
-
-
-``&lt;updatecheck&gt;``
-''''''''''''''''''
-
-This feature can update an already installed package, therefore removing
-superfluous files after installation. Here's how this feature author (Tino
-Schwarze) described it on the IzPack development mailing-list:
-
-&gt; Each pack can now specify an ``&lt;updatecheck&gt;`` tag. It supports a subset of
-ant fileset syntax, e.g.:
-
-::
-
-    &lt;updatecheck&gt;
-      &lt;include name=&quot;lib/**&quot; /&gt;
-      &lt;exclude name=&quot;config/local/** /&gt;
-    &lt;/updatecheck&gt;
-
-
-&gt; If the paths are relative, they will be matched relative to
-``$INSTALL_PATH``. Update checks are only enabled if at least one
-``&lt;include&gt;`` is specified. See `` com.izforge.izpack.installer.Unpacker``
-for details.
-
-
-
-``&lt;file&gt;`` - add files or directories
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-The ``&lt;file&gt;`` tag specifies a file (a directory is a file too) to include
-into the pack. It takes the following attributes:
-
--   ``src``: the file location (relative path) - if this is a directory
-    its content will be added recursively
--   ``targetdir``: the destination directory, could be something like
-    ``$INSTALL_PATH/subdirX``
--   ``os``: can optionally specify a target operating system (``unix,
-    windows, mac``) - this means that the file will only be installed on its
-    target operating system
--   ``override``: if ``true`` then if the file is already installed, it
-    will be overwritten. Alternative values: ``asktrue`` and ``askfalse`` -
-    ask the user what to do and supply default value for non-interactive use.
-    Another possible values is ``update``. It means that the new file is only
-    installed if it's modification time is newer than the modification time
-    of the already existing file (note that this is not a reliable mechanism
-    for updates - you cannot detect whether a file was altered after
-    installation this way.) By default it is set to `` update``.
--   ``unpack``: if ``true`` and the file is an archive then its content
-    will be unpacked and added as individual files
-
-
-
-``&lt;additionaldata&gt;``
-'''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This tag can also be specified in order to pass additional data related to a
-file tag for customizing.
-
--   ``&lt;key&gt;``: key to identify the data
--   ``&lt;value&gt;``: value which can be used by a custom action
-
-
-
-``&lt;singlefile&gt;`` - add a single file
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Specifies a single file to include. The difference to ``&lt;file&gt;`` is that this
-tag allows the file to be renamed, therefore it has a ``target`` attribute
-instead of `` targetdir``.
-
--   ``src``: the file location (relative path)
--   ``target``: the destination file name, could be something like
-    ``$INSTALL_PATH/subdirX/fileY``
--   ``os``: can optionally specify a target operating system (``unix,
-    windows, mac``) - this means that the file will only be installed on its
-    target operating system
--   ``override``: see ``&lt;file&gt;`` for description
-
-A ``&lt;additionaldata&gt;`` tag can also be specified for customizing.
-
-
-
-``&lt;fileset&gt;``: add a fileset
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-The ``&lt;fileset&gt;`` tag allows files to be specified using the powerful Jakarta
-Ant set syntax. It takes the following parameters:
-
--   ``dir``: the base directory for the fileset (relative path)
--   ``targetdir``: the destination path, works like for ``&lt;file&gt;``
--   ``casesensitive``: optionally lets you specify if the names are case-
-    sensitive or not - takes ``yes`` or ``no``
--   ``defaultexcludes``: optionally lets you specify if the default
-    excludes will be used - takes ``yes`` or ``no``.
--   ``os``: specifies the operating system, works like for ``&lt;file&gt;``
--   ``override``: see ``&lt;file&gt;`` for description
--   ``includes``: comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files
-    that must be included; all files are included when omitted. This is an
-    alternative for multiple include tags.
--   ``excludes``: comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files
-    that must be excluded; no files (except default excludes) are excluded
-    when omitted. This is an alternative for multiple exclude tags.
-
-You specify the files with ``&lt;include&gt;`` and ``&lt;exclude&gt;`` tags that take the
-``name`` parameter to specify the Ant-like pattern :
-
--   ``**`` : means any subdirectory
--   ``*`` : used as a wildcard.
-
-Here are some examples of Ant patterns :
-
--   ``&lt;include name=&quot;lib&quot;/&gt;`` : will include ``lib`` and the
-    subdirectories of ``lib``
--   ``&lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;`` : will exclude any file in any
-    directory starting from the base path ending by ``.java``
--   ``&lt;include name=&quot;lib/*.jar&quot;/&gt;`` : will include all the files ending
-    by ``.jar`` in ``lib``
--   ``&lt;exclude name=&quot;lib/**/*FOO*&quot;/&gt;`` : will exclude any file in any
-    subdirectory starting from ``lib`` whose name contains ``FOO``.
-
-There area set of definitions that are excluded by default file-sets, just as
-in Ant. IzPack defaults to the Ant list of default excludes. There is
-currently no equivalent to the &lt;defaultexcludes&gt; task. Default excludes are:
-
-::
-
-         **/*\~{}
-         **/\#*\#
-         **/.\#*
-         **/%*%
-         **/.\_*
-         **/CVS
-         **/CVS/**
-         **/.cvsignore
-         **/SCCS
-         **/SCCS/**
-         **/vssver.scc
-         **/.svn
-         **/.svn/**
-         **/.DS\_Store
-
-
-A ``&lt;additionaldata&gt;`` tag can also be specified for customizing.
-
-
-``&lt;parsable&gt;`` - parse a file after installation
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Files specified by ``&lt;parsable&gt;`` are parsed after installation and may have
-variables substituted.
-
--   ``targetfile`` : the file to parse, could be something like
-    ``$INSTALL_PATH/bin/launch-script.sh``
-    A slash will be changed to the system dependant path separator (e.g. to a
-    backslash on Windows) only if no backslash masks the slash.
--   ``type`` : specifies the type (same as for the resources) - the
-    default is ``plain``
--   ``encoding`` : specifies the file encoding
--   ``os``: specifies the operating system, works like for ``&lt;file&gt;``
-
-
-``&lt;executable&gt;`` - mark file executable or execute it
-'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-The ``&lt;executable&gt;`` tag is a very useful thing if you need to execute
-something during the installation process. It can also be used to set the
-executable flag on Unix-like systems. Here are the attributes :
-
--   ``targetfile`` : the file to run, could be something like
-    ``$INSTALL_PATH/bin/launch-script.sh``
-    Slashes are handled special (see attribute ``targetfile`` of tag
-    ``&lt;parsable&gt;``).
--   ``class`` : If the executable is a jar file, this is the class to run
-    for a JavaTM program
--   ``type`` : ``bin`` or ``jar`` (the default is ``bin``)
--   ``stage`` : specifies when to launch : ``postinstall`` is just after
-    the installation is done, ``never`` will never launch it (useful to set
-    the +x flag on Unix). ``uninstall`` will launch the executable when the
-    application is uninstalled. The executable is executed before any files
-    are deleted. ``never`` is the default value.
--   ``failure`` : specifies what to do when an error occurs : ``abort``
-    will abort the installation process, ``ask`` (default) will ask the user
-    what to do and ``warn`` will just tell the user that something is wrong
--   ``os``: specifies the operating system, works like for ``&lt;file&gt;``
--   ``keep`` : specifies whether the file will be kept after execution.
-    The default is to delete the file after is has been executed. This can be
-    changed by specifying ``keep=&quot;true&quot;``.
-
-A ``&lt;args&gt;`` tag can also be specified in order to pass arguments to the
-executable:
-
--   ``&lt;arg&gt;``: passes the argument specified in the ``value`` attribute.
-    Slashes are handled special (see attribute ``targetfile`` of tag
-    ``&lt;parsable&gt;``.
-
-
-
-``&lt;os&gt;`` - make a file OS-dependent
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-The ``&lt;os&gt;`` tag can be used inside the ``&lt;file&gt;``, ``&lt;fileset&gt;``,
-``&lt;singlefile&gt;``, ``&lt;parsable&gt;``, ``&lt;executable&gt;`` tags to restrict it's
-effect to a specific operating system family, architecture or version:
-
--   ``family``: ``unix, windows, mac`` to specify the operating system
-    family
--   ``name``: the operating system name
--   ``version``: the operating system version
--   ``arch``: the operating system architecture (for instance the Linux
-    kernel can run on i386, sparc, and so on)
-
-Here's an example installation file :
-
-::
-
-    &lt;packs&gt;
-        &lt;!-- The core files --&gt;
-        &lt;pack name=&quot;Core&quot; required=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
-            &lt;description&gt;The IzPack core files.&lt;/description&gt;
-            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;bin&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;lib&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;legal&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;Readme.txt&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;Versions.txt&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;Thanks.txt&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;parsable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/izpack-fe&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;parsable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/izpack-
-            fe.bat&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;parsable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/compile&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;parsable
-            targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/compile.bat&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;executable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/compile&quot;
-            stage=&quot;never&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;executable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/izpack-fe&quot;
-            stage=&quot;never&quot;/&gt;
-        &lt;/pack&gt;
-
-        &lt;!-- The documentation (1 directory) --&gt;
-        &lt;pack name=&quot;Documentation&quot; required=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
-            &lt;description&gt;The IzPack documentation (HTML and
-            PDF).&lt;/description&gt;
-            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;doc&quot;/&gt;
-        &lt;/pack&gt;
-    &lt;/packs&gt;
-
-
-The Native Element ``&lt;native&gt;``
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Use this if you want to use a feature that requires a native library. The
-native libraries are placed under ``bin/native/..``. There are 2 kinds of
-native libraries : the iZPACK libraries and the third-party ones. The IzPack
-libraries are located at ``bin/native/izpack``, you can place your own
-libraries at `` bin/native/3rdparty``. It is possible to place a native
-library also into the uninstaller. It is useable from CustomActions.
-If one or more are referenced for it, the needed support classes are
-automatically placed into the uninstaller. To place it only on operating
-systems for which they are build, it is possible to define an OS restriction.
-This restriction will only be performed for the uninstaller. The markup takes
-the following attributes :
-
--   ``type`` : ``izpack`` or ``3rdparty``
--   ``name`` : the library filename
--   ``stage``: stage where to use the library (install|uninstall|both)
-
-
-``&lt;os&gt;`` - make a library OS-dependent
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-The ``&lt;os&gt;`` tag can be used to restrict the inclusion into the uninstaller
-to a specific operating system family, architecture or version. The inclusion
-into the installer will be always done.
-
-Here's a sample :
-
-::
-
-    &lt;native type=&quot;izpack&quot; name=&quot;ShellLink.dll&quot;/&gt;
-
-
-The Jar Merging Element ``&lt;jar&gt;``
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-If you adapt iZPACK for your own needs, you might need to merge the content
-of another jar file into the jar installer. For instance, this could be a
-library that you need to merge. The ``&lt;jar&gt;`` markup allows you to merge the
-raw content of another jar file into the installer and the uninstaller. It is
-necessary that the paths in the jars are unique because only the contained
-files of the jar are added to the installer jar, not the jar file self. The
-attributes are:
-
--   ``src`` : the path at compile time
--   ``stage``: stage where to use the contents of the additional jar file
-    (install|uninstall|both)
-
-A sample :
-
-::
-
-    &lt;jar src=&quot;../nicelibrary.jar&quot;/&gt;
-
-The Available Panels
----------------------
-
-In this section i will introduce the various panels available in IzPack. The
-usage for most is pretty simple and described right here. The more elaborate
-ones are explained in more detail in the *Advanced Features* chapter or in
-their own chapter. The panels are listed by their class name. This is the
-name that must be used with the ``classname`` attribute. Please be aware that
-the classname is Case-Sensitive, meaning that if the case from the
-install.xml and the founded class file differs the installation will break.
-In this last case, the installer will Throw an IllegalArgumentException in
-the compiler if the declared class name in the xml file differs in case from
-the founded class file.
-
-
-
-HelloPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This panel welcomes the user by displaying the project name, the version, the
-URL as well as the authors.
-
-
-
-CheckedHelloPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This panel welcomes the user also by displaying the project name, the
-version, the URL as well as the authors.
-
-
-Additonal on windows the registry will be scanned for an entry which
-determines that the product is already installed. If so, a dialog will be
-shown which ask whether to install a second version of the product or not. If
-you use this panel do not forget to add the `registry feature` into your
-installation.
-
-
-InfoPanel and HTMLInfoPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This is a kind of 'README' panel. It presents text of any length. The text is
-specified by the ``(HTML)InfoPanel.info`` resource. Starting from IzPack
-3.7.0, variables substitution is allowed.
-To add an image to the HTMLInfoPanel you simply need to add a ressource to
-your install.xml with an ID decided by you, then you can call this image by
-refering it by this same ID.
-
-In install.xml:
-
-::
-
-    &lt;resources&gt;
-      &lt;res src=&quot;logo.jpg&quot; id=&quot;GHGHGH&quot;/&gt;
-      .....
-
-and in file.html:
-
-::
-
-    &lt;img src=&quot;GHGHGH&quot; /&gt;
-
-
-LicencePanel and HTMLLicencePanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Note:* There is a mistake in the name - it should be LicensePanel. In France
-the word is Licence ... and one of my diploma is a 'Licence' so ...:* -)
-
-
-Adding images to HTMLLicencePanel works exactly the same way as with
-HTMLInfoPanel.
-
-These panels can prompt the user to acknowledge a license agreement. They
-block unless the user selects the 'agree' option. To specify the license
-agreement text you have to use the `` (HTML)LicencePanel.licence`` resource.
-
-
-
-PacksPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Allows the user to select the packs he wants to install.
-
-
-
-ImgPacksPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This is the same as above, but for each pack a different picture is shown to
-the user. The pictures are specified using the packImgId attribute for each
-pack in the installer XML. The initial image will be the image of the first
-pack that has a packImgId. The image is updated each time the user
-(de)selects a pack that has a packImgId. Of course it's up to you to specify
-an image for each pack in your installation with a unique packImgId. For
-instance if you have 2 packs ``core`` and ``documentation`` (in this order),
-and you assign both packs a packImgId that is identical to the pack's name
-then the resource for ``core`` will be ``core`` and the resource for
-``documentation`` will be ``documentation``. The initially shown image will
-be the resource ``core``. The supported image formats depend on what your
-client's JVM supports, but starting from J2SE 1.3, *GIF*, *JPEG* and *PNG*
-are supported.
-
-
-
-TargetPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This panel allows the user to select the installation path. It can be
-customized with the following resources (they are text files containing the
-path) :
-
--   ``TargetPanel.dir.f`` where f stands for the family (``mac, macosx,
-    windows, unix``)
--   ``TargetPanel.dir`` : the directory name, instead of the software to
-    install name
--   ``TargetPanel.dir.d`` where d is a &quot;dynamic&quot; name, as returned by the
-    JavaTM virtual machine. You should write the name in lowercase and
-    replace the spaces with underscores. For instance, you might want a
-    different setting for Solaris and GNU/Linux which are both Unix-like
-    systems. The resources would be ``TargetPanel.dir.sunos,
-    TargetPanel.dir.linux``. You should have a Unix-resource in case it
-    wouldn't work though.
-
-
-InstallPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-You should always have this one as it launches the installation process !
-
-
-
-XInfoPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-A panel showing text parsed by the variable substitutor. The text can be
-specified through the ``XInfoPanel.info`` resource. This panel can be useful
-when you have to show information after the installation process is completed
-(for instance if the text contains the target path).
-
-
-
-FinishPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-A ending panel, able to write automated installer information. For details
-see the chapter on 'Advanced Features'.
-
-
-
-SimpleFinishPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-Same as ``FinishPanel``, but without the automated installer features. It is
-aimed at making the life easier for end-users who will never encounter the
-automated installer extra feature.
-
-
-
-ShortcutPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This panel is used to create desktop shortcuts. For details on using the
-ShortcutPanel see the chapter 'Desktop Shortcuts'.
-
-
-UserInputPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This panel allows you to prompt the user for data. What the user is prompted
-for is specified using an XML file which is included as a resource to the
-installer.
-
-
-CompilePanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This panel allows you to compile just installed Java sourcecode. The details
-for the compilation are specified using the resource
-``CompilePanel.Spec.xml``. The XML file has the following format:
-
-::
-
-    &lt;compilation&gt;
-      &lt;global&gt;
-        &lt;compiler&gt;
-          &lt;choice value=&quot;$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac&quot; /&gt;
-          &lt;choice value=&quot;jikes&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;/compiler&gt;
-        &lt;arguments&gt;
-          &lt;choice value=&quot;-O -g:none&quot; /&gt;
-          &lt;choice value=&quot;-O&quot; /&gt;
-          &lt;choice value=&quot;-g&quot; /&gt;
-          &lt;choice value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;/arguments&gt;
-      &lt;/global&gt;
-      &lt;jobs&gt;
-        &lt;classpath add=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;job name=&quot;optional name&quot;&gt;
-          &lt;directory name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/xyz&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;/job&gt;
-        &lt;job name=&quot;another job&quot;&gt;
-          &lt;packdepency name=&quot;some package name&quot; /&gt;
-          &lt;classpath sub=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/&quot; /&gt;
-          &lt;directory name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/abc&quot; /&gt;
-          &lt;file name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/some/file.java&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;/job&gt;
-      &lt;/jobs&gt;
-    &lt;/compilation&gt;
-
-
-In theory, jobs can be nested but this has not been tested at all. A change
-to the classpath within a job only affects this job and nested jobs. The
-classpath should be specified before any files or directories.
-
-The user can change the compiler to use and choose from some default
-compilation options before compilation is started.
-
-.. image:: ./compilePanel.png
-    :alt: CompilePanel
-
-
-
-ProcessPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This panel allows you to execute arbitrary files after installation. The
-details for the compilation are specified using the resource
-``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml``.
-
-The XML file has the following format:
-
-::
-
-    &lt;processing&gt;
-      &lt;job name=&quot;do xyz&quot;&gt;
-        &lt;os family=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;executefile name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.bat&quot;&gt;
-          &lt;arg&gt;doit&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;arg&gt;$variable&lt;/arg&gt;
-        &lt;/executefile&gt;
-      &lt;/job&gt;
-      &lt;job name=&quot;do xyz&quot;&gt;
-        &lt;os family=&quot;unix&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;executefile name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.sh&quot;&gt;
-          &lt;arg&gt;doit&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;arg&gt;$variable&lt;/arg&gt;
-        &lt;/executefile&gt;
-      &lt;/job&gt;
-    &lt;/processing&gt;
-
-
-Each job may have an ``&lt;os&gt;`` attribute.
-
-
-
-``&lt;executeclass&gt;`` - Execute Java Classes
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-It is also possible to execute Java classes from this panel. Here's what this
-feature author (Alex Bradley) says:
-
-&gt; i've been able to work around my requirements by extending the
-``ProcessPanelWorker`` functionality to run user-specified classes. i've
-extended the DTD of the `` ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` to include a new element:
-
-::
-
-    &lt;executeclass name=&quot;classname&quot;&gt;
-    &lt;args..../&gt;
-    &lt;/executeclass&gt;
-
-
-&gt; i've also added a new sub-class of ``Processable`` called ``executeclass``.
-This will run a user-specified class in the context of the installer JVM with
-a single method :
-
-::
-
-    run( AbstractUIProcessHandler handler, String[] args]);
-
-
-&gt; It can do everything i need and more. In particular, it allows me to write
-a process extension and still be able to provide feedback to the user through
-the feedback panel, and to add new functionality to the installer, after its
-been built.
-
-To use the executeclass facility, you will need to create a jar file with
-your class and then add it to the installer with the `The Jar Merging
-Element`.
-
-
-``&lt;executeForPack&gt;`` - Only execute the job for certain packs
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-This can be be used to run the job only if the pack is enabled. For example,
-the batch file will if either the ``Sources`` or ``Executables`` packs are
-selected at install time.
-
-::
-
-    &lt;processing&gt;
-     &lt;job name=&quot;List files&quot;&gt;
-      &lt;executeForPack name=&quot;Sources&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;executeForPack name=&quot;Executables&quot;/&gt;
-      &lt;os family=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;
-      &lt;executefile name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH\batch\ListFiles.bat&quot; /&gt;
-     &lt;/job&gt;
-    &lt;/processing&gt;
-
-``&lt;logfiledir&gt;`` - Output of the processPanel saved to a log
-~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-
-New with version 3.7 is the possibility to tee output that is written to the
-ProcessPanel's textarea into an optional logfile. Using this feature is
-pretty much straightforward, you only have to add a line in
-``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` that will tell IzPack the location, where the
-logfile should be stored.
-
-Variable substitution is performed, so you can use ``$INSTALL_PATH`` as
-example.
-
-The name of the logfile is not (yet) configurable but should fit in most
-cases. It will be named
-
-::
-
-    Install_V&lt;$APP_VER&gt;_&lt;YYYY&gt;-&lt;MM&gt;-&lt;DD&gt;_&lt;hh&gt;-&lt;mm&gt;-&lt;ss&gt;_&lt;RandomId&gt;.log
-
-
-Here's an example:
-
-::
-
-    &lt;processing&gt;
-      &lt;logfiledir&gt;$INSTALL_PATH&lt;/logfiledir&gt;
-      &lt;job name=&quot;do xyz&quot;&gt;
-        &lt;os family=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;
-        &lt;executefile name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.bat&quot;&gt;
-          &lt;arg&gt;doit&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;arg&gt;$variable&lt;/arg&gt;
-        &lt;/executefile&gt;
-    &lt;/processing&gt;
-
-
-This will generate a logfile named e.g.
-``Install_V1.3_2004-11-08_19-22-20_43423.log`` located in ``$INSTALL_PATH``.
-
-``ProcessPanelWorker`` will write all output that is directed to ``stdout``
-and ``stderr`` to this file if ``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` contains the
-``logfiledir`` entry.
-
-Please note that this one file is used for storing the complete output of all
-jobs and not a file for each job that is run.
-
-
-JDKPathPanel
-'''''''''''''
-
-This panel allows the user to select a JDK path. The variable JAVA_HOME does
-not point to a JDK, else to a JRE also the environment variable points to a
-JDK. This is not a bug, this is the behavior of the VM. But some products
-needs a JDK, for that this panel can be used. There is not only a selection
-of the path else a validation. The validation will be done with the file
-JDKPath/lib/tools.jar. If JAVA_HOME points to the VM which is placed in the
-JDK, the directory will be used as default (JAVA_HOME/..). If there is the
-variable
-
-::
-
-    JDKPathPanel.skipIfValid
-
-
-defined with the value &quot;yes&quot;, the panel will be skiped if the path is valid.
-Additional it is possible to make a version control. If one or both variables
-
-::
-
-    JDKPathPanel.minVersion
-    JDKPathPanel.maxVersion
-
-
-are defined, only a JDK will be accepted which has a version in the range of
-it. The detection is a little bit pragmatically, therefor it is possible,
-that the detection can fail at some VMs. The values in the install.xml should
-be like
-
-::
-
-    &lt;variables&gt;
-      &lt;variable name=&quot;JDKPathPanel.minVersion&quot; value=&quot;1.4.1&quot; /&gt;
-      &lt;variable name=&quot;JDKPathPanel.maxVersion&quot; value=&quot;1.4.99&quot; /&gt;
-      &lt;variable name=&quot;JDKPathPanel.skipIfValid&quot; value=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;
-    &lt;/variables&gt;
-
-
-If all is valid, the panels isValidated method sets the variable
-
-::
-
-    JDKPath
-
-
-to the chosen path. Be aware, this variable exist not until the JDKPanel was
-quitted once. At a secound activation, the default will be the last
-selection.
-
-
-SelectPrinterPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This panel will look at the local printers installed and propose a list box
-with all of them. Once chosen, the variable $SELECTED_PRINTER is set to the
-user choice.
-
-
-DataCheckPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-DataCheckPanel is not for inclusion in an actuall install, but is a debugging
-resource for developers writing custom panels or code to be included in
-IzPack.
-It creates a list of all the variables in InstallData, their values and a
-list of all packs, indicating which are selected.
-This list is printed to the console and appears in a scrollable text area on
-the panel.
-Put the panel in wherever you want to see any variables in InstallData or a
-listing of the packs with a line like this in the &lt;panels&gt; section of
-install.xml:
-
-&lt;panel classname=&quot;DataCheckPanel&quot; /&gt;
-
-It will automatically give you a full list of all the variables and packs
-whenever the panel is made active.
-
-
-SummaryPanel
-'''''''''''''
-
-This panel gives a summary of all shown panels. The best place for it is just
-infront of the InstallPanel. Normaly it contains a warning that this is the
-last panel before installation. The panel contains a scrollable HTML text
-area to display the summary. The informations are collected from each panel
-by calling the methods ``getSummaryCaption`` and ``getSummaryBody``.
-``getSummaryCaption`` is implemented in ``IzPanel`` with a panel name default
-text. ``getSummaryBody`` has to be implemented in all panels which should be
-presented in the summary. If the secound method is not implemented, no
-summary of this panel will be shown.
-
-Additional it is possible to `log the contents` of the summary panel into a
-HTML file.
-
-
-InstallationGroupPanel
-''''''''''''''''''''''''''
-
-This Panel groups the pack together. A panel which displays the available
-*installGroups* found on the packs to allow the user to select a subset of
-the packs based on the pack *installGroups* attribute. This panel will be
-skipped if there are no pack elements with an *installGroups* attribute. For
-example ::
-
-        &lt;installation version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
-           (...)
-            &lt;panels&gt;
-                (...)
-                &lt;panel classname=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel&quot;/&gt;
-                &lt;panel classname=&quot;PacksPanel&quot;/&gt;
-                (...)
-            &lt;/panels&gt;
-
-            &lt;packs&gt;
-                &lt;pack name=&quot;Base&quot;
-                    installGroups=&quot;Group1&quot;
-                    required=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
-                    (...)
-                &lt;/pack&gt;
-                &lt;pack name=&quot;Docs&quot;
-                    installGroups=&quot;Group1,Group2&quot;
-                    required=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
-                    (...)
-                &lt;/pack&gt;
-                &lt;pack name=&quot;Sources&quot;
-                    installGroups=&quot;Group3,Group2&quot;
-                    required=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
-                    (...)
-                &lt;/pack&gt;
-            &lt;/packs&gt;
-        &lt;/installation&gt;
-        
-In above example when InstallationGroupPanel is displayed,
-it contains three radios named Group1, Group2 and Group3. Depending
-on what user selects, the respective Packs will be displayed in
-PacksPanel. InstallationGroupPanel will look for a description
-corresponding to the key
-&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.description.Group1&quot;,
-&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.description.Group2&quot; etc in installation
-langpacks and variables and displays this description for each of
-the Group_i.
-
-You may also define a sortKey in the variables section of the installer.xml
-to define an alternative sorting. The default sorting is based on the Group
-Name.
-
-Here is an example for alternative sorting of groups: ::
-
-        (...)
-        &lt;variables&gt;
-           (...)
-            &lt;variable
-            name=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group2&quot; value=&quot;A&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;variable
-            name=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group1&quot; value=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;
-            &lt;variable
-            name=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group3&quot; value=&quot;C&quot;/&gt;
-        &lt;/variables&gt;
-        (...)
+Writing Installation XML Files
+==============================
+
+
+What You Need
+-------------
+
+
+Your editor
+'''''''''''
+
+In order to write your XML installation files, you just need a plain text
+editor. Of course it's always easier to work with color coded text, so you
+might rather want to work with a text editor having such a feature. Here is a
+list of free editors that work well :
+
+-   Jext : <A HREF="http://www.jext.org/">http://www.jext.org/</A>
+-   JEdit : <A HREF="http://www.jedit.org/">http://www.jedit.org/</A>
+-   classics like Vim and (X)Emacs.
+
+If you are a developer and tend to write your own patches, extension or
+features to IzPack sources, or, if you wish to debug your compilation,
+installation and uninstallation, we recommend these IDE:
+
+-   IntelliJ IDEA : <A HREF="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/</A>
+-   Eclipse : <A HREF="http://www.eclipse.org/">http://www.eclipse.org/</A>
+-   Netbeans : <A HREF="http://www.netbeans.org/">http://www.netbeans.org/</A>
+
+For the first one, JetBrains has granted us an Open Source License. All
+project members can ask the Licence Key to one of the project manager.
+
+The other ones are well know open source projects (Just like us :-)). We provide
+a tutorial on how to develop/debug IzPack using Eclipse in the chapter
+''Getting Started &gt; How to develop and debug IpPack using Eclipse''
+
+
+Writing XML
+'''''''''''
+
+Though you might not know much about XML, you have certainly heard about it.
+If you know XML you can skip this subsection as we will briefly present how
+to use XML.
+
+
+XML is a markup language, really close to HTML. If you've ever worked with
+HTML the transition will be fast. However there are a few little things to
+know. The markups used in XML have the following form : ``&lt;markup&gt;``. Each
+markup has to be closed somewhere with its ending tag : ``&lt;/markup&gt;``. Each
+tag can contain text and other markups. If a markup does not contain
+anything, it is just reported once : ``&lt;markup/&gt;``. A markup can contain
+attributes like : ``&lt;markup attr1=&quot;123&quot; attr2=&quot;hello !&quot;/&gt;``. Here is a sample
+of a valid XML structure :
+
+::
+
+    &lt;chapter title=&quot;Chapter 1&quot;&gt;
+      &lt;section name=&quot;Introduction&quot;&gt;
+        &lt;paragraph&gt;
+        This is the text of the paragraph number 1. It is available
+        for the very low
+        price of &lt;price currency=&quot;dollar&quot;&gt;1 000 000&lt;/price&gt;.
+        &lt;/paragraph&gt;
+      &lt;/section&gt;
+      &lt;section name=&quot;xxx&quot;&gt;
+      xxx
+      &lt;/section&gt;
+    &lt;/chapter&gt;
+
+
+You should be aware of the following common mistakes :
+
+-   markups **are** case sensitive : ``&lt;markup&gt;`` is different from
+    ``&lt;Markup&gt;``.
+-   you **must** close the markups in the same order as you create them :
+    ``&lt;m1&gt;&lt;m2&gt;(...)&lt;/m2&gt;&lt;/m1&gt;`` is right but `` &lt;m1&gt;&lt;m2&gt;(...)&lt;/m1&gt;&lt;/m2&gt;`` is
+    not.
+
+Also, an XML file must start with the following header :
+``&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;iso-8859-1 standalone=&quot;yes&quot; ?&gt;``. The only
+thing you should modify is the encoding (put here the one your text editor
+saves your files to). The `` standalone`` attribute is not very important for
+us.
+
+
+This (brief !) introduction to XML was just meant to enable you to write your
+installation specification. For a better introduction there are plenty of
+books and articles/tutorials dealing with XML on the Internet, in book
+stores, in magazines and so on.
+
+Variable Substitution
+---------------------
+
+During the installation process IzPack can substitute variables in various
+places with real values. Obvious targets for variable substitution are
+resource files and launch scripts, however you will notice many more places
+where it is more powerful to use variables rather then hard coded values.
+Wherever variables can be used it will be explained in the documentation.
+
+
+There are three types of variables:
+
+-   Built-In variables. These are implemented in IzPack and are all
+    dynamic in nature. This means that the value of each variable depends on
+    local conditions on the target system.
+-   Environment variables. These are provided by the operating system the
+    installer is run on.
+-   Variables that you can define. You also define the value, which is
+    fixed for a given installation file.
+
+You define your own variables in the installation XML file with the
+``&lt;variable&gt;`` tag. How to do this is explained in detail later in this
+chapter.
+
+
+**Please note** that when using variables they must always appear with a
+'``$``' sign as the first character, even though they are not defined this
+way.
+
+
+
+The Built-In Variables
+----------------------
+
+The following variables are built-in :
+
+-   ``$INSTALL_PATH`` : the installation path on the target system, as
+    chosen by the user
+-   ``$APPLICATIONS_DEFAULT_ROOT`` : the default path for applications
+-   ``$JAVA_HOME`` : the JavaTM virtual machine home path
+-   ``$CLASS_PATH`` : the Class Path used mainly for Java Applications
+-   ``$USER_HOME`` : the user's home directory path
+-   ``$USER_name`` : the user name
+-   ``$APP_name`` : the application name
+-   ``$APP_URL`` : the application URL
+-   ``$APP_VER`` : the application version
+-   ``$ISO3_LANG`` : the ISO3 language code of the selected langpack.
+-   ``$IP_ADDRESS`` : the IP Address of the local machine.
+-   ``$HOST_NAME`` : the HostName of the local machine.
+-   ``$FILE_SEPARATOR`` : the file separator on the installation system
+-   ``$DesktopShortcutCheckboxEnabled`` : When set to true, it
+    automatically checks the &quot;Create Desktop Shortcuts&quot; button. To see how to
+    use it, go to `The Variables Element ``&lt;variables&gt;`` Be careful this
+    variable is case sensitve !
+-   ``$InstallerFrame.logfilePath`` : The path to the install log. This
+    file contains the paths of all installed files. If set to &quot;default&quot; then
+    the &quot;$INSTALL_PATH/Uninstaller/install.log&quot; path will be used. To see how
+    to use it, go to `The Variables Element ``&lt;variables&gt;``. If this
+    variable is not set, no install.log will be created.
+
+
+Environment Variables
+---------------------
+
+Environment variables can be accessed via the syntax ``${ENV[variable]}``.
+The curly braces are mandatory. Note that variable names are case-sensitive
+and usually in UPPER CASE.
+
+Example: To get the value of the OS environment variable &quot;CATALINA_HOME&quot;, use
+``${ENV[CATALINA_HOME]}``.
+
+
+Parse Types
+-----------
+
+Parse types apply only when replacing variables in text files. At places
+where it might be necessary to specify a parse type, the documentation will
+mention this. Depending on the parse type, IzPack will handle special cases
+-such as escaping control characters- correctly. The following parse types
+are available:
+
+-   ``plain`` - use this type for plain text files, where no special
+    substitution rules apply. All variables will be replaced with their
+    respective values as is.
+-   ``javaprop`` - use this type if the substitution happens in a Java
+    properties file. Individual variables might be modified to function
+    properly within the context of Java property files.
+-   ``xml`` - use this type if the substitution happens in a XML file.
+    Individual variables might be modified to function properly within the
+    context of XML files.
+-   ``shell`` - use this type if the substitution happens in a shell
+    script. Because shell scripts use ``$variable`` themselves, an
+    alternative variable marker is used: ``%variable`` or ``%{variable}``.
+
+
+The IzPack Elements
+-------------------
+
+*When writing your installer XML files, it's a good idea to have a look at
+the iZPACK installation DTD*.
+
+
+
+
+The Root Element ``&lt;installation&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+The root element of an installation is ``&lt;installation&gt;``. It takes one
+required attribute : ``version``. The attribute defines the version of the
+XML file layout and is used by the compiler to identify if it is compatible
+with the XML file. This should be set to **1.0** for the moment.
+
+
+The Information Element ``&lt;info&gt;``
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This element is used to specify some general information for the installer.
+It contains the following elements :
+
+-   ``&lt;appname&gt;`` : the application name
+-   ``&lt;appversion&gt;`` : the application version
+-   ``&lt;appsubpath&gt;`` : the subpath for the default of the installation
+    path. A variable substitution and a maskable slash-backslash conversion
+    will be done. If this tag is not defined, the application name will be
+    used instead.
+-   ``&lt;url&gt;`` : the application official website url
+-   ``&lt;authors&gt;`` : specifies the author(s) of the application. It must
+    contain at least one ``&lt;author&gt;`` element whose attributes are :
+
+    -   ``name`` : the author's name
+    -   ``email`` : the author's email
+
+-   ``&lt;uninstaller&gt;`` : specifies whether to create an uninstaller after
+    installation, and which name to use for it. This tag has the ``write``
+    attribute, with default value `` yes``. If this tag is not specified, the
+    uninstaller will still be written. The ``name`` attribute can be used to
+    change the default name of the generated uninstaller, *i.e.* ``
+    uninstaller.jar``.
+-   ``&lt;javaversion&gt;`` : specifies the minimum version of Java required to
+    install your program. Values can be ``1.2``, ``1.2.2``, ``1.4``, etc. The
+    test is a lexical comparison against the ``java.version`` System property
+    on the install machine.
+-   ``&lt;webdir&gt;`` : Causes a ''web installer'' to be created, and
+    specifies the URL packages are retrieved from at install time. The
+    content of the tag must be a properly formed URL.
+-   ``&lt;summarylogfilepath&gt;`` : specifies the path for the logfile of the
+    `SummaryLoggerInstallerListener`.
+
+Here is an example of a typical ``&lt;info&gt;`` section :
+
+
+::
+
+    &lt;info&gt;
+      &lt;appname&gt;Super extractor&lt;/appname&gt;
+      &lt;appversion&gt;2.1 beta 6&lt;/appversion&gt;
+      &lt;appsubpath&gt;myCompany/SExtractor&lt;/appsubpath&gt;
+      &lt;url&gt;<A HREF="http://www.superextractor.com/&lt;/url">http://www.superextractor.com/&lt;/url</A>&gt;
+      &lt;authors&gt;
+        &lt;author name=&quot;John John Doo&quot; email=&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/izpack-changes">jjd at jjd-mail.com</A>&quot;/&gt;
+        &lt;author name=&quot;El Goyo&quot; email=&quot;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/izpack-changes">goyoman at mymail.org</A>&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;/authors&gt;
+      &lt;javaversion&gt;1.2&lt;/javaversion&gt;
+    &lt;/info&gt;
+
+The Packaging Element ``&lt;packaging&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This element allows to specify packaging options. If not specified, the default will be to create an all in one
+installer. This element will usually be used to create an installer which spans over multiple volumes, 
+e.g. the output will be two CDs. The packaging-element contains the following elements:
+
+-   ``&lt;packager&gt;`` : specifies options used by the packager. The packager tag has the ``class`` attribute,
+    which specifys the class to use for packaging. Currently two implementations
+    are available (com.izforge.izpack.compiler.Packager, com.izforge.izpack.compiler.MultiVolumePackager).
+    The packager-element can contain the ``&lt;options&gt;`` element which can have different attributes for the different
+    implementations of packagers. For the MultiVolumePackager, it can have the following attributes:
+    
+    -	``volumesize``: the size of the volumes
+    -	``firstvolumefreespace``: free space on the first volume used for the installer jar and additional resources like
+    	readme-files etc.
+    
+    
+-   ``&lt;unpacker&gt;`` : specifies which unpacker class should be used. Currently there are two unpacker implementations
+	(com.izforge.izpack.compiler.UnPacker, com.izforge.izpack.compiler.MultiVolumeUnPacker).
+  
+Here's an example how to specify an installer which will create multiple volumes. In this example the volumes shall be
+CDs with 650 megabytes. There will be an additional free space of 150 megabytes on the first volume. This will result in
+the creation of an installer.jar and multiple installer.pak* files. The installer.jar plus installer.pak plus the additional
+resources have to be copied on the first volume, each installer.pak.&lt;number&gt; on several volumes. 
+  
+::
+
+ 	  &lt;packaging&gt;
+	    &lt;packager class=&quot;com.izforge.izpack.compiler.MultiVolumePackager&quot;&gt;
+			&lt;!-- 650 MB volumes, 150 MB space on the first volume --&gt;
+	        &lt;options volumesize=&quot;681574400&quot; firstvolumefreespace=&quot;157286400&quot;/&gt;
+	    &lt;/packager&gt;
+	    &lt;unpacker class=&quot;com.izforge.izpack.installer.MultiVolumeUnpacker&quot; /&gt;
+	  &lt;/packaging&gt;
+
+The Variables Element ``&lt;variables&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This element allows you to define variables for the variables substitution
+system. Some variables are built-in, such as ``$INSTALL_PATH`` (which is the
+installation path chosen by the user). When you define a set of variables,
+you just have to place as many ``&lt;variable&gt;`` tags in the file as needed. If
+you define a variable named ``VERSION`` you need to type $VERSION in the
+files to parse. The variable substitutor will then replace it with the
+correct value. One ``&lt;variable&gt;`` tag take the following attributes :
+
+-   ``name`` : the variable name
+-   ``value`` : the variable value
+
+Here's a sample ``&lt;variables&gt;`` section :
+
+
+::
+
+    &lt;variables&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;app-version&quot; value=&quot;1.4&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;released-on&quot; value=&quot;08/03/2002&quot;/&gt;
+    &lt;/variables&gt;
+
+
+Here's a precise sample on how to use desktopshortcutcheckboxenabled and
+InstallerFrame.logfilePath variables:
+
+
+::
+
+    &lt;variables&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;InstallerFrame.logfilePath&quot; value=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH
+      /My-install.log&quot;/&gt;
+        &lt;!-- This means that the log name will be My-install and that
+      it will be stored at the root of the installation. --&gt;
+        &lt;!-- Any path is fine. If value is set to &quot;Default&quot; then
+      &quot;$INSTALL_PATH/uninstall/install.log&quot; is used. --&gt;
+        &lt;!-- And if variable isn't defined then no log is written. --&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;desktopshortcutcheckboxenabled&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;
+        &lt;!-- This automatically checks the &quot;Create Desktop Shortcuts&quot;
+      button. Default value is &quot;False&quot;. --&gt;
+    &lt;/variables&gt;
+
+
+The GUI Preferences Element ``&lt;guiprefs&gt;``
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This element allows you to set the behavior of your installer GUI. This
+information will not have any effect on the command-line installers that will
+be available in future versions of iZPACK . The arguments to specify are :
+
+-   ``resizable`` : takes ``yes`` or ``no`` and indicates whether the
+    window size can be changed or not.
+-   ``width`` : sets the initial window width
+-   ``height`` : sets the initial window height.
+
+Here's a sample :
+
+::
+
+    &lt;guiprefs resizable=&quot;no&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;600&quot;/&gt;
+
+
+Starting from IzPack 3.6, the look and feel can be specified in this section
+on a per-OS basis. For instance you can use the native look and feels on
+Win32 and OS X but use a third-party one on Unix-like platforms. To do that,
+you have to add some children to the ``guiprefs`` tag:
+
+-   ``laf``: the tag that specifies a look and feel. It has a ``name``
+    parameter that defines the look and feel name.
+-   Each ``laf`` element needs at least one ``os`` tag, specified like in
+    the other parts of the specification that support this tag.
+-   Like you can add ``os`` elements, you can add any number of ``param``
+    elements to customize a look and feel. A ``param`` elements has two
+    attribues: ``name`` and `` value``.
+
+The available look and feels are:
+
+-   Kunststoff: ``kunststoff``
+-   Liquid: ``liquid``
+-   Metouia: ``metouia``
+-   JGoodies Looks: ``looks``
+-   Substance: ``substance``
+
+If you don't specify a look and feel for a particular operating system, then
+the default native one will be used: Windows on Windows, Aqua on Mac OS X and
+Metal on the Unix-like variants.
+
+
+The *Liquid Look and Feel* supports the following parameters:
+
+-   ``decorate.frames``: ``yes`` means that it will render the frames in
+    Liquid style
+-   ``decorate.dialogs``: ``yes`` means that it will render the dialogs
+    in Liquid style
+
+The *JGoodies Looks* look and feel can be specified by using the ``variant``
+parameters. The values can be one of:
+
+-   ``windows``: use the Windows look
+-   ``plastic``: use the basic Plastic look
+-   ``plastic3D``: use the Plastic 3D look
+-   ``plasticXP``: use the Plastic XP look (default).
+
+Here is a small sample:
+
+::
+
+    &lt;guiprefs height=&quot;600&quot; resizable=&quot;yes&quot; width=&quot;800&quot;&gt;
+        &lt;laf name=&quot;metouia&quot;&gt;
+            &lt;os family=&quot;unix&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;/laf&gt;
+        &lt;laf name=&quot;looks&quot;&gt;
+            &lt;os family=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;
+            &lt;param name=&quot;variant&quot; value=&quot;extwin&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;/laf&gt;
+    &lt;/guiprefs&gt;
+
+
+The *Substance* look and feel *toned-down* themes can be specified using the
+``variant`` parameter, with the value being one of: ``business, business-
+blue, business-black, creme, sahara, moderate, officesilver``. We have
+reduced the choice to the toned-down themes since they are the only ones to
+actually look decent (the other families colors are way too saturated).
+Please consult <A HREF="https://substance.dev.java.net/docs/skins/toneddown.html">https://substance.dev.java.net/docs/skins/toneddown.html</A>
+for a gallery of the different toned-down themes.
+
+Starting from IzPack 3.7, some characteristics can be customized with the
+``&lt;modifier&gt;`` tag. There is a separate description in the `Advanced
+Features` chapter paragraph `Modifying the GUI`.
+
+
+
+The Localization Element ``&lt;locale&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This element is used to specify the language packs (langpacks) that you want
+to use for your installer. You must set one ``&lt;langpack&gt;`` markup per
+language. This markup takes the `` iso3`` parameter which specifies the iso3
+language code.
+
+
+Here's a sample :
+
+
+::
+
+    &lt;locale&gt;
+      &lt;langpack iso3=&quot;eng&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;langpack iso3=&quot;fra&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;langpack iso3=&quot;spa&quot;/&gt;
+    &lt;/locale&gt;
+
+
+The supported ISO3 codes are :
+
+========= ============================
+ISO3 code Language

+
+
+The Resources Element ``&lt;resources&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Several panels, such as the license panel and the shortcut panel, require
+additional data to perform their task. This data is supplied in the form of
+resources. This section describes how to specify them. Take a look at each
+panel description to see if it might need any resources. Currently, no checks
+are made to ensure resources needed by any panel have been included. The ``
+&lt;resources&gt;`` element is not required, and no ``&lt;res&gt;`` elements are required
+within.
+The ``&lt;resources&gt;`` element is the only element besides the ``&lt;packs&gt;``
+element that is taken into consideration in referenced pack-files (see
+```&lt;packs&gt;`` element`_ for more info)
+
+
+You have to set one ``&lt;res&gt;`` markup for each resource. Here are the
+attributes to specify :
+
+-   ``src`` : the path to the resource file which can be named freely of
+    course (for instance ``my-picture.jpg``).
+-   ``id`` : the resource id, depending on the needs of a particular
+    panel
+-   ``parse`` : takes ``yes`` or ``no`` (default is ``no``) - used to
+    specify whether the resource must be parsed at the installer compilation
+    time. For instance you could set the application version in a readme file
+    used by ``InfoPanel``.
+-   ``type`` : specifies the parse type. This makes sense only for a text
+    resource - the default is ``plain``, other values are ``javaprop, xml``
+    (Java properties file and XML files)
+-   ``encoding`` : specifies the resource encoding if the receiver needs
+    to know. This makes sense only for a text resource.
+
+Here's a sample :
+
+::
+
+    &lt;resources&gt;
+      &lt;res id=&quot;InfoPanel.info&quot; src=&quot;doc/readme.txt&quot; parse=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;res id=&quot;LicencePanel.licence&quot; src=&quot;legal/License.txt&quot;/&gt;
+    &lt;/resources&gt;
+
+
+The Panels Element ``&lt;panels&gt;``
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Here you tell the compiler which panels you want to use. They will appear in
+the installer in the order in which they are listed in your XML installation
+file. Take a look at the different panels in order to find the ones you need.
+The ``&lt;panel&gt;`` markup takes a single attribute ``classname`` which is the
+classname of the panel.
+
+
+Here's a sample :
+
+::
+
+    &lt;panels&gt;
+      &lt;panel classname=&quot;HelloPanel&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;panel classname=&quot;LicencePanel&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;panel classname=&quot;TargetPanel&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;panel classname=&quot;InstallPanel&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;panel classname=&quot;FinishPanel&quot;/&gt;
+    &lt;/panels&gt;
+
+
+The Packs Element ``&lt;packs&gt;``
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This is a crucial section as it is used to specify the files that need to be
+installed. The ``&lt;packs&gt;`` section consists of several ``&lt;pack&gt;`` and
+``&lt;refpack&gt;`` tags.
+
+The ``&lt;pack&gt;`` takes the following attributes :
+
+-   ``name``: the pack name
+-   ``required``: takes ``yes`` or ``no`` and specifies whether the pack
+    is optional or not.
+-   ``os``: optional attribute that lets you make the pack targeted to a
+    specific *operating system*, for instance ``unix``, ``mac`` and so on.
+-   ``preselected``: optional attribute that lets you choose whether the
+    pack is by default selected for installation or not. Possible values are
+    ``yes`` and ``no``. A pack which is not preselected needs to be
+    explicitly selected by the user during installation to get installed.
+-   ``loose``: can be used so that the files are not located in the
+    installer Jar. The possible values are ``true`` or ``false``, the default
+    beeing ``false``. The author of this feature needed to put his
+    application on a CD so that the users could run it directly from this
+    media. However, he also wanted to offer them the possibility to install
+    the software localy. Enabling this feature will make IzPack take the
+    files on disk instead of from the installer. *Please make sure that your
+    relative files paths are correct !*
+-   ``id``: this attribute is used to give a unique id to the pack to be
+    used for internationalization.
+-   ``packImgId``: this attribute is used to reference a unique resource
+    that represents the pack's image for the ImgPacksPanel. The resource
+    should be defined in the ``&lt;resources&gt;`` element of the installation XML
+    using the same value for the ``id`` attribute of the ``&lt;res&gt;`` element.
+
+The ``&lt;refpack&gt;`` takes only one attribute ``file``, which contains the
+relative path (from the installation compiler) to an externally defined
+packs-definition. This external packs definition is a regular IzPack
+installation XML. However the only elements that are used from that XML file
+are the ``&lt;packs&gt;`` and the ``&lt;resources&gt;`` elements. This enables a model in
+which a single developer is responsible for maintaining the packs and
+resources related to the development-package assigned to him. The main
+install XML references these xml-files to avoid synchronization efforts
+between the central installation XML and the developer-maintained installer
+XMLs.
+
+Internationalization of the PacksPanel
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+In order to provide internationalization for the PacksPanel, so that your
+users can be presented with a different name and description for each
+language you support, you have to create a file named ``packsLang.xml_xyz``
+where ``xyz`` is the ISO3 code of the language in lowercase. Please be aware
+that case is significant. This file has to be inserted in the resources
+section of `` install.xml`` with the ``id`` and ``src`` attributes set at the
+name of the file. The format of these files is identical with the
+distribution langpack files located at ``
+$IZPACK_HOME/bin/langpacks/installer``. For the name of the panel you just
+use the pack ``id`` as the txt ``id``. For the description you use the pack
+``id`` suffixed with ``.description``.
+
+The following sections describe the tags available for a ``&lt;pack&gt;`` section.
+
+
+``&lt;description&gt;`` - pack description
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+The contents of the ``&lt;description&gt;`` tag describe the pack contents. This
+description is displayed if the user highlights the pack during installation.
+
+
+``&lt;depends&gt;`` - pack dependencies
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This can be used to make this pack selectable only to be installed only if
+some other is selected to be installed. The pack can depend on more than one
+by specifying more than one `` &lt;depends&gt;`` elements.
+Circular depedencies are not supported and the compiler reports an error if
+one occurs.
+
+This tag takes the following attribute:
+
+-   ``packname``: The name of the pack that it depends on
+
+
+``&lt;os&gt;`` - OS restrictions
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+It is possible to restrict a panel to a certain list of operating systems.
+This tag takes the following attributes:
+
+-   ``family``: unix, windows or mac
+-   ``name``: the exact OS name (ie Windows, Linux, ...)
+-   ``version``: the exact OS version (see the JVM ``os.version``
+    property)
+-   ``arch``: the machine architecture (see the JVM ``os.arch``
+    property).
+
+
+``&lt;updatecheck&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''
+
+This feature can update an already installed package, therefore removing
+superfluous files after installation. Here's how this feature author (Tino
+Schwarze) described it on the IzPack development mailing-list:
+
+&gt; Each pack can now specify an ``&lt;updatecheck&gt;`` tag. It supports a subset of
+ant fileset syntax, e.g.:
+
+::
+
+    &lt;updatecheck&gt;
+      &lt;include name=&quot;lib/**&quot; /&gt;
+      &lt;exclude name=&quot;config/local/** /&gt;
+    &lt;/updatecheck&gt;
+
+
+&gt; If the paths are relative, they will be matched relative to
+``$INSTALL_PATH``. Update checks are only enabled if at least one
+``&lt;include&gt;`` is specified. See `` com.izforge.izpack.installer.Unpacker``
+for details.
+
+
+
+``&lt;file&gt;`` - add files or directories
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+The ``&lt;file&gt;`` tag specifies a file (a directory is a file too) to include
+into the pack. It takes the following attributes:
+
+-   ``src``: the file location (relative path) - if this is a directory
+    its content will be added recursively
+-   ``targetdir``: the destination directory, could be something like
+    ``$INSTALL_PATH/subdirX``
+-   ``os``: can optionally specify a target operating system (``unix,
+    windows, mac``) - this means that the file will only be installed on its
+    target operating system
+-   ``override``: if ``true`` then if the file is already installed, it
+    will be overwritten. Alternative values: ``asktrue`` and ``askfalse`` -
+    ask the user what to do and supply default value for non-interactive use.
+    Another possible values is ``update``. It means that the new file is only
+    installed if it's modification time is newer than the modification time
+    of the already existing file (note that this is not a reliable mechanism
+    for updates - you cannot detect whether a file was altered after
+    installation this way.) By default it is set to `` update``.
+-   ``unpack``: if ``true`` and the file is an archive then its content
+    will be unpacked and added as individual files
+
+
+
+``&lt;additionaldata&gt;``
+'''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This tag can also be specified in order to pass additional data related to a
+file tag for customizing.
+
+-   ``&lt;key&gt;``: key to identify the data
+-   ``&lt;value&gt;``: value which can be used by a custom action
+
+
+
+``&lt;singlefile&gt;`` - add a single file
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Specifies a single file to include. The difference to ``&lt;file&gt;`` is that this
+tag allows the file to be renamed, therefore it has a ``target`` attribute
+instead of `` targetdir``.
+
+-   ``src``: the file location (relative path)
+-   ``target``: the destination file name, could be something like
+    ``$INSTALL_PATH/subdirX/fileY``
+-   ``os``: can optionally specify a target operating system (``unix,
+    windows, mac``) - this means that the file will only be installed on its
+    target operating system
+-   ``override``: see ``&lt;file&gt;`` for description
+
+A ``&lt;additionaldata&gt;`` tag can also be specified for customizing.
+
+
+
+``&lt;fileset&gt;``: add a fileset
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+The ``&lt;fileset&gt;`` tag allows files to be specified using the powerful Jakarta
+Ant set syntax. It takes the following parameters:
+
+-   ``dir``: the base directory for the fileset (relative path)
+-   ``targetdir``: the destination path, works like for ``&lt;file&gt;``
+-   ``casesensitive``: optionally lets you specify if the names are case-
+    sensitive or not - takes ``yes`` or ``no``
+-   ``defaultexcludes``: optionally lets you specify if the default
+    excludes will be used - takes ``yes`` or ``no``.
+-   ``os``: specifies the operating system, works like for ``&lt;file&gt;``
+-   ``override``: see ``&lt;file&gt;`` for description
+-   ``includes``: comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files
+    that must be included; all files are included when omitted. This is an
+    alternative for multiple include tags.
+-   ``excludes``: comma- or space-separated list of patterns of files
+    that must be excluded; no files (except default excludes) are excluded
+    when omitted. This is an alternative for multiple exclude tags.
+
+You specify the files with ``&lt;include&gt;`` and ``&lt;exclude&gt;`` tags that take the
+``name`` parameter to specify the Ant-like pattern :
+
+-   ``**`` : means any subdirectory
+-   ``*`` : used as a wildcard.
+
+Here are some examples of Ant patterns :
+
+-   ``&lt;include name=&quot;lib&quot;/&gt;`` : will include ``lib`` and the
+    subdirectories of ``lib``
+-   ``&lt;exclude name=&quot;**/*.java&quot;/&gt;`` : will exclude any file in any
+    directory starting from the base path ending by ``.java``
+-   ``&lt;include name=&quot;lib/*.jar&quot;/&gt;`` : will include all the files ending
+    by ``.jar`` in ``lib``
+-   ``&lt;exclude name=&quot;lib/**/*FOO*&quot;/&gt;`` : will exclude any file in any
+    subdirectory starting from ``lib`` whose name contains ``FOO``.
+
+There area set of definitions that are excluded by default file-sets, just as
+in Ant. IzPack defaults to the Ant list of default excludes. There is
+currently no equivalent to the &lt;defaultexcludes&gt; task. Default excludes are:
+
+::
+
+         **/*\~{}
+         **/\#*\#
+         **/.\#*
+         **/%*%
+         **/.\_*
+         **/CVS
+         **/CVS/**
+         **/.cvsignore
+         **/SCCS
+         **/SCCS/**
+         **/vssver.scc
+         **/.svn
+         **/.svn/**
+         **/.DS\_Store
+
+
+A ``&lt;additionaldata&gt;`` tag can also be specified for customizing.
+
+
+``&lt;parsable&gt;`` - parse a file after installation
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Files specified by ``&lt;parsable&gt;`` are parsed after installation and may have
+variables substituted.
+
+-   ``targetfile`` : the file to parse, could be something like
+    ``$INSTALL_PATH/bin/launch-script.sh``
+    A slash will be changed to the system dependant path separator (e.g. to a
+    backslash on Windows) only if no backslash masks the slash.
+-   ``type`` : specifies the type (same as for the resources) - the
+    default is ``plain``
+-   ``encoding`` : specifies the file encoding
+-   ``os``: specifies the operating system, works like for ``&lt;file&gt;``
+
+
+``&lt;executable&gt;`` - mark file executable or execute it
+'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+The ``&lt;executable&gt;`` tag is a very useful thing if you need to execute
+something during the installation process. It can also be used to set the
+executable flag on Unix-like systems. Here are the attributes :
+
+-   ``targetfile`` : the file to run, could be something like
+    ``$INSTALL_PATH/bin/launch-script.sh``
+    Slashes are handled special (see attribute ``targetfile`` of tag
+    ``&lt;parsable&gt;``).
+-   ``class`` : If the executable is a jar file, this is the class to run
+    for a JavaTM program
+-   ``type`` : ``bin`` or ``jar`` (the default is ``bin``)
+-   ``stage`` : specifies when to launch : ``postinstall`` is just after
+    the installation is done, ``never`` will never launch it (useful to set
+    the +x flag on Unix). ``uninstall`` will launch the executable when the
+    application is uninstalled. The executable is executed before any files
+    are deleted. ``never`` is the default value.
+-   ``failure`` : specifies what to do when an error occurs : ``abort``
+    will abort the installation process, ``ask`` (default) will ask the user
+    what to do and ``warn`` will just tell the user that something is wrong
+-   ``os``: specifies the operating system, works like for ``&lt;file&gt;``
+-   ``keep`` : specifies whether the file will be kept after execution.
+    The default is to delete the file after is has been executed. This can be
+    changed by specifying ``keep=&quot;true&quot;``.
+
+A ``&lt;args&gt;`` tag can also be specified in order to pass arguments to the
+executable:
+
+-   ``&lt;arg&gt;``: passes the argument specified in the ``value`` attribute.
+    Slashes are handled special (see attribute ``targetfile`` of tag
+    ``&lt;parsable&gt;``.
+
+
+
+``&lt;os&gt;`` - make a file OS-dependent
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+The ``&lt;os&gt;`` tag can be used inside the ``&lt;file&gt;``, ``&lt;fileset&gt;``,
+``&lt;singlefile&gt;``, ``&lt;parsable&gt;``, ``&lt;executable&gt;`` tags to restrict it's
+effect to a specific operating system family, architecture or version:
+
+-   ``family``: ``unix, windows, mac`` to specify the operating system
+    family
+-   ``name``: the operating system name
+-   ``version``: the operating system version
+-   ``arch``: the operating system architecture (for instance the Linux
+    kernel can run on i386, sparc, and so on)
+
+Here's an example installation file :
+
+::
+
+    &lt;packs&gt;
+        &lt;!-- The core files --&gt;
+        &lt;pack name=&quot;Core&quot; required=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
+            &lt;description&gt;The IzPack core files.&lt;/description&gt;
+            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;bin&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;lib&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;legal&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;Readme.txt&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;Versions.txt&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;Thanks.txt&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;parsable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/izpack-fe&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;parsable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/izpack-
+            fe.bat&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;parsable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/compile&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;parsable
+            targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/compile.bat&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;executable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/compile&quot;
+            stage=&quot;never&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;executable targetfile=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/bin/izpack-fe&quot;
+            stage=&quot;never&quot;/&gt;
+        &lt;/pack&gt;
+
+        &lt;!-- The documentation (1 directory) --&gt;
+        &lt;pack name=&quot;Documentation&quot; required=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
+            &lt;description&gt;The IzPack documentation (HTML and
+            PDF).&lt;/description&gt;
+            &lt;file targetdir=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH&quot; src=&quot;doc&quot;/&gt;
+        &lt;/pack&gt;
+    &lt;/packs&gt;
+
+
+The Native Element ``&lt;native&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Use this if you want to use a feature that requires a native library. The
+native libraries are placed under ``bin/native/..``. There are 2 kinds of
+native libraries : the iZPACK libraries and the third-party ones. The IzPack
+libraries are located at ``bin/native/izpack``, you can place your own
+libraries at `` bin/native/3rdparty``. It is possible to place a native
+library also into the uninstaller. It is useable from CustomActions.
+If one or more are referenced for it, the needed support classes are
+automatically placed into the uninstaller. To place it only on operating
+systems for which they are build, it is possible to define an OS restriction.
+This restriction will only be performed for the uninstaller. The markup takes
+the following attributes :
+
+-   ``type`` : ``izpack`` or ``3rdparty``
+-   ``name`` : the library filename
+-   ``stage``: stage where to use the library (install|uninstall|both)
+
+
+``&lt;os&gt;`` - make a library OS-dependent
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+The ``&lt;os&gt;`` tag can be used to restrict the inclusion into the uninstaller
+to a specific operating system family, architecture or version. The inclusion
+into the installer will be always done.
+
+Here's a sample :
+
+::
+
+    &lt;native type=&quot;izpack&quot; name=&quot;ShellLink.dll&quot;/&gt;
+
+
+The Jar Merging Element ``&lt;jar&gt;``
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+If you adapt iZPACK for your own needs, you might need to merge the content
+of another jar file into the jar installer. For instance, this could be a
+library that you need to merge. The ``&lt;jar&gt;`` markup allows you to merge the
+raw content of another jar file into the installer and the uninstaller. It is
+necessary that the paths in the jars are unique because only the contained
+files of the jar are added to the installer jar, not the jar file self. The
+attributes are:
+
+-   ``src`` : the path at compile time
+-   ``stage``: stage where to use the contents of the additional jar file
+    (install|uninstall|both)
+
+A sample :
+
+::
+
+    &lt;jar src=&quot;../nicelibrary.jar&quot;/&gt;
+
+The Available Panels
+---------------------
+
+In this section i will introduce the various panels available in IzPack. The
+usage for most is pretty simple and described right here. The more elaborate
+ones are explained in more detail in the *Advanced Features* chapter or in
+their own chapter. The panels are listed by their class name. This is the
+name that must be used with the ``classname`` attribute. Please be aware that
+the classname is Case-Sensitive, meaning that if the case from the
+install.xml and the founded class file differs the installation will break.
+In this last case, the installer will Throw an IllegalArgumentException in
+the compiler if the declared class name in the xml file differs in case from
+the founded class file.
+
+
+
+HelloPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This panel welcomes the user by displaying the project name, the version, the
+URL as well as the authors.
+
+
+
+CheckedHelloPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This panel welcomes the user also by displaying the project name, the
+version, the URL as well as the authors.
+
+
+Additonal on windows the registry will be scanned for an entry which
+determines that the product is already installed. If so, a dialog will be
+shown which ask whether to install a second version of the product or not. If
+you use this panel do not forget to add the `registry feature` into your
+installation.
+
+
+InfoPanel and HTMLInfoPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This is a kind of 'README' panel. It presents text of any length. The text is
+specified by the ``(HTML)InfoPanel.info`` resource. Starting from IzPack
+3.7.0, variables substitution is allowed.
+To add an image to the HTMLInfoPanel you simply need to add a ressource to
+your install.xml with an ID decided by you, then you can call this image by
+refering it by this same ID.
+
+In install.xml:
+
+::
+
+    &lt;resources&gt;
+      &lt;res src=&quot;logo.jpg&quot; id=&quot;GHGHGH&quot;/&gt;
+      .....
+
+and in file.html:
+
+::
+
+    &lt;img src=&quot;GHGHGH&quot; /&gt;
+
+
+LicencePanel and HTMLLicencePanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Note:* There is a mistake in the name - it should be LicensePanel. In France
+the word is Licence ... and one of my diploma is a 'Licence' so ...:* -)
+
+
+Adding images to HTMLLicencePanel works exactly the same way as with
+HTMLInfoPanel.
+
+These panels can prompt the user to acknowledge a license agreement. They
+block unless the user selects the 'agree' option. To specify the license
+agreement text you have to use the `` (HTML)LicencePanel.licence`` resource.
+
+
+
+PacksPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Allows the user to select the packs he wants to install.
+
+
+
+ImgPacksPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This is the same as above, but for each pack a different picture is shown to
+the user. The pictures are specified using the packImgId attribute for each
+pack in the installer XML. The initial image will be the image of the first
+pack that has a packImgId. The image is updated each time the user
+(de)selects a pack that has a packImgId. Of course it's up to you to specify
+an image for each pack in your installation with a unique packImgId. For
+instance if you have 2 packs ``core`` and ``documentation`` (in this order),
+and you assign both packs a packImgId that is identical to the pack's name
+then the resource for ``core`` will be ``core`` and the resource for
+``documentation`` will be ``documentation``. The initially shown image will
+be the resource ``core``. The supported image formats depend on what your
+client's JVM supports, but starting from J2SE 1.3, *GIF*, *JPEG* and *PNG*
+are supported.
+
+
+
+TargetPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This panel allows the user to select the installation path. It can be
+customized with the following resources (they are text files containing the
+path) :
+
+-   ``TargetPanel.dir.f`` where f stands for the family (``mac, macosx,
+    windows, unix``)
+-   ``TargetPanel.dir`` : the directory name, instead of the software to
+    install name
+-   ``TargetPanel.dir.d`` where d is a &quot;dynamic&quot; name, as returned by the
+    JavaTM virtual machine. You should write the name in lowercase and
+    replace the spaces with underscores. For instance, you might want a
+    different setting for Solaris and GNU/Linux which are both Unix-like
+    systems. The resources would be ``TargetPanel.dir.sunos,
+    TargetPanel.dir.linux``. You should have a Unix-resource in case it
+    wouldn't work though.
+
+
+InstallPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+You should always have this one as it launches the installation process !
+
+
+
+XInfoPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+A panel showing text parsed by the variable substitutor. The text can be
+specified through the ``XInfoPanel.info`` resource. This panel can be useful
+when you have to show information after the installation process is completed
+(for instance if the text contains the target path).
+
+
+
+FinishPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+A ending panel, able to write automated installer information. For details
+see the chapter on 'Advanced Features'.
+
+
+
+SimpleFinishPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+Same as ``FinishPanel``, but without the automated installer features. It is
+aimed at making the life easier for end-users who will never encounter the
+automated installer extra feature.
+
+

+ShortcutPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This panel is used to create desktop shortcuts. For details on using the
+ShortcutPanel see the chapter 'Desktop Shortcuts'.
+
+
+UserInputPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This panel allows you to prompt the user for data. What the user is prompted
+for is specified using an XML file which is included as a resource to the
+installer.
+
+
+CompilePanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This panel allows you to compile just installed Java sourcecode. The details
+for the compilation are specified using the resource
+``CompilePanel.Spec.xml``. The XML file has the following format:
+
+::
+
+    &lt;compilation&gt;
+      &lt;global&gt;
+        &lt;compiler&gt;
+          &lt;choice value=&quot;$JAVA_HOME/bin/javac&quot; /&gt;
+          &lt;choice value=&quot;jikes&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;/compiler&gt;
+        &lt;arguments&gt;
+          &lt;choice value=&quot;-O -g:none&quot; /&gt;
+          &lt;choice value=&quot;-O&quot; /&gt;
+          &lt;choice value=&quot;-g&quot; /&gt;
+          &lt;choice value=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;/arguments&gt;
+      &lt;/global&gt;
+      &lt;jobs&gt;
+        &lt;classpath add=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;job name=&quot;optional name&quot;&gt;
+          &lt;directory name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/xyz&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;/job&gt;
+        &lt;job name=&quot;another job&quot;&gt;
+          &lt;packdepency name=&quot;some package name&quot; /&gt;
+          &lt;classpath sub=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/&quot; /&gt;
+          &lt;directory name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/src/classes/abc&quot; /&gt;
+          &lt;file name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/some/file.java&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;/job&gt;
+      &lt;/jobs&gt;
+    &lt;/compilation&gt;
+
+
+In theory, jobs can be nested but this has not been tested at all. A change
+to the classpath within a job only affects this job and nested jobs. The
+classpath should be specified before any files or directories.
+
+The user can change the compiler to use and choose from some default
+compilation options before compilation is started.

+
+
+ProcessPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This panel allows you to execute arbitrary files after installation. The
+details for the compilation are specified using the resource
+``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml``.
+
+The XML file has the following format:
+
+::
+
+    &lt;processing&gt;
+      &lt;job name=&quot;do xyz&quot;&gt;
+        &lt;os family=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;executefile name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.bat&quot;&gt;
+          &lt;arg&gt;doit&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;arg&gt;$variable&lt;/arg&gt;
+        &lt;/executefile&gt;
+      &lt;/job&gt;
+      &lt;job name=&quot;do xyz&quot;&gt;
+        &lt;os family=&quot;unix&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;executefile name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.sh&quot;&gt;
+          &lt;arg&gt;doit&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;arg&gt;$variable&lt;/arg&gt;
+        &lt;/executefile&gt;
+      &lt;/job&gt;
+    &lt;/processing&gt;
+
+
+Each job may have an ``&lt;os&gt;`` attribute.
+
+
+
+``&lt;executeclass&gt;`` - Execute Java Classes
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+It is also possible to execute Java classes from this panel. Here's what this
+feature author (Alex Bradley) says:
+
+&gt; i've been able to work around my requirements by extending the
+``ProcessPanelWorker`` functionality to run user-specified classes. i've
+extended the DTD of the `` ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` to include a new element:
+
+::
+
+    &lt;executeclass name=&quot;classname&quot;&gt;
+    &lt;args..../&gt;
+    &lt;/executeclass&gt;
+
+
+&gt; i've also added a new sub-class of ``Processable`` called ``executeclass``.
+This will run a user-specified class in the context of the installer JVM with
+a single method :
+
+::
+
+    run( AbstractUIProcessHandler handler, String[] args]);
+
+
+&gt; It can do everything i need and more. In particular, it allows me to write
+a process extension and still be able to provide feedback to the user through
+the feedback panel, and to add new functionality to the installer, after its
+been built.
+
+To use the executeclass facility, you will need to create a jar file with
+your class and then add it to the installer with the `The Jar Merging
+Element`.
+
+
+``&lt;executeForPack&gt;`` - Only execute the job for certain packs
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+This can be be used to run the job only if the pack is enabled. For example,
+the batch file will if either the ``Sources`` or ``Executables`` packs are
+selected at install time.
+
+::
+
+    &lt;processing&gt;
+     &lt;job name=&quot;List files&quot;&gt;
+      &lt;executeForPack name=&quot;Sources&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;executeForPack name=&quot;Executables&quot;/&gt;
+      &lt;os family=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;
+      &lt;executefile name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH\batch\ListFiles.bat&quot; /&gt;
+     &lt;/job&gt;
+    &lt;/processing&gt;
+
+``&lt;logfiledir&gt;`` - Output of the processPanel saved to a log
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+New with version 3.7 is the possibility to tee output that is written to the
+ProcessPanel's textarea into an optional logfile. Using this feature is
+pretty much straightforward, you only have to add a line in
+``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` that will tell IzPack the location, where the
+logfile should be stored.
+
+Variable substitution is performed, so you can use ``$INSTALL_PATH`` as
+example.
+
+The name of the logfile is not (yet) configurable but should fit in most
+cases. It will be named
+
+::
+
+    Install_V&lt;$APP_VER&gt;_&lt;YYYY&gt;-&lt;MM&gt;-&lt;DD&gt;_&lt;hh&gt;-&lt;mm&gt;-&lt;ss&gt;_&lt;RandomId&gt;.log
+
+
+Here's an example:
+
+::
+
+    &lt;processing&gt;
+      &lt;logfiledir&gt;$INSTALL_PATH&lt;/logfiledir&gt;
+      &lt;job name=&quot;do xyz&quot;&gt;
+        &lt;os family=&quot;windows&quot; /&gt;
+        &lt;executefile name=&quot;$INSTALL_PATH/scripts/xyz.bat&quot;&gt;
+          &lt;arg&gt;doit&lt;/arg&gt;&lt;arg&gt;$variable&lt;/arg&gt;
+        &lt;/executefile&gt;
+    &lt;/processing&gt;
+
+
+This will generate a logfile named e.g.
+``Install_V1.3_2004-11-08_19-22-20_43423.log`` located in ``$INSTALL_PATH``.
+
+``ProcessPanelWorker`` will write all output that is directed to ``stdout``
+and ``stderr`` to this file if ``ProcessPanel.Spec.xml`` contains the
+``logfiledir`` entry.
+
+Please note that this one file is used for storing the complete output of all
+jobs and not a file for each job that is run.
+
+
+JDKPathPanel
+'''''''''''''
+
+This panel allows the user to select a JDK path. The variable JAVA_HOME does
+not point to a JDK, else to a JRE also the environment variable points to a
+JDK. This is not a bug, this is the behavior of the VM. But some products
+needs a JDK, for that this panel can be used. There is not only a selection
+of the path else a validation. The validation will be done with the file
+JDKPath/lib/tools.jar. If JAVA_HOME points to the VM which is placed in the
+JDK, the directory will be used as default (JAVA_HOME/..). If there is the
+variable
+
+::
+
+    JDKPathPanel.skipIfValid
+
+
+defined with the value &quot;yes&quot;, the panel will be skiped if the path is valid.
+Additional it is possible to make a version control. If one or both variables
+
+::
+
+    JDKPathPanel.minVersion
+    JDKPathPanel.maxVersion
+
+
+are defined, only a JDK will be accepted which has a version in the range of
+it. The detection is a little bit pragmatically, therefor it is possible,
+that the detection can fail at some VMs. The values in the install.xml should
+be like
+
+::
+
+    &lt;variables&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;JDKPathPanel.minVersion&quot; value=&quot;1.4.1&quot; /&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;JDKPathPanel.maxVersion&quot; value=&quot;1.4.99&quot; /&gt;
+      &lt;variable name=&quot;JDKPathPanel.skipIfValid&quot; value=&quot;yes&quot; /&gt;
+    &lt;/variables&gt;
+
+
+If all is valid, the panels isValidated method sets the variable
+
+::
+
+    JDKPath
+
+
+to the chosen path. Be aware, this variable exist not until the JDKPanel was
+quitted once. At a secound activation, the default will be the last
+selection.
+
+
+SelectPrinterPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This panel will look at the local printers installed and propose a list box
+with all of them. Once chosen, the variable $SELECTED_PRINTER is set to the
+user choice.
+
+
+DataCheckPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+DataCheckPanel is not for inclusion in an actuall install, but is a debugging
+resource for developers writing custom panels or code to be included in
+IzPack.
+It creates a list of all the variables in InstallData, their values and a
+list of all packs, indicating which are selected.
+This list is printed to the console and appears in a scrollable text area on
+the panel.
+Put the panel in wherever you want to see any variables in InstallData or a
+listing of the packs with a line like this in the &lt;panels&gt; section of
+install.xml:
+
+&lt;panel classname=&quot;DataCheckPanel&quot; /&gt;
+
+It will automatically give you a full list of all the variables and packs
+whenever the panel is made active.
+
+
+SummaryPanel
+'''''''''''''
+
+This panel gives a summary of all shown panels. The best place for it is just
+infront of the InstallPanel. Normaly it contains a warning that this is the
+last panel before installation. The panel contains a scrollable HTML text
+area to display the summary. The informations are collected from each panel
+by calling the methods ``getSummaryCaption`` and ``getSummaryBody``.
+``getSummaryCaption`` is implemented in ``IzPanel`` with a panel name default
+text. ``getSummaryBody`` has to be implemented in all panels which should be
+presented in the summary. If the secound method is not implemented, no
+summary of this panel will be shown.
+
+Additional it is possible to `log the contents` of the summary panel into a
+HTML file.
+
+
+InstallationGroupPanel
+''''''''''''''''''''''''''
+
+This Panel groups the pack together. A panel which displays the available
+*installGroups* found on the packs to allow the user to select a subset of
+the packs based on the pack *installGroups* attribute. This panel will be
+skipped if there are no pack elements with an *installGroups* attribute. For
+example ::
+
+        &lt;installation version=&quot;1.0&quot;&gt;
+           (...)
+            &lt;panels&gt;
+                (...)
+                &lt;panel classname=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel&quot;/&gt;
+                &lt;panel classname=&quot;PacksPanel&quot;/&gt;
+                (...)
+            &lt;/panels&gt;
+
+            &lt;packs&gt;
+                &lt;pack name=&quot;Base&quot;
+                    installGroups=&quot;Group1&quot;
+                    required=&quot;yes&quot;&gt;
+                    (...)
+                &lt;/pack&gt;
+                &lt;pack name=&quot;Docs&quot;
+                    installGroups=&quot;Group1,Group2&quot;
+                    required=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
+                    (...)
+                &lt;/pack&gt;
+                &lt;pack name=&quot;Sources&quot;
+                    installGroups=&quot;Group3,Group2&quot;
+                    required=&quot;no&quot;&gt;
+                    (...)
+                &lt;/pack&gt;
+            &lt;/packs&gt;
+        &lt;/installation&gt;
+        
+In above example when InstallationGroupPanel is displayed,
+it contains three radios named Group1, Group2 and Group3. Depending
+on what user selects, the respective Packs will be displayed in
+PacksPanel. InstallationGroupPanel will look for a description
+corresponding to the key
+&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.description.Group1&quot;,
+&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.description.Group2&quot; etc in installation
+langpacks and variables and displays this description for each of
+the Group_i.
+
+You may also define a sortKey in the variables section of the installer.xml
+to define an alternative sorting. The default sorting is based on the Group
+Name.
+
+Here is an example for alternative sorting of groups: ::
+
+        (...)
+        &lt;variables&gt;
+           (...)
+            &lt;variable
+            name=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group2&quot; value=&quot;A&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;variable
+            name=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group1&quot; value=&quot;B&quot;/&gt;
+            &lt;variable
+            name=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.sortKey.Group3&quot; value=&quot;C&quot;/&gt;
+        &lt;/variables&gt;
+        (...)
+
+By default, your group name (and description) are displayed as-is in the
+installer. If you want them to be localized, add localized names to your
+``packsLang.xml`` resources. The string ID has to be 
+InstallationGroupPanel.group.```group_name``.
+
+Here is an example to localize groups into French (these lines have to be put
+in your ``packsLang.xml_fra`` resource) :
+::
+
+&lt;str id=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.group.Core&quot; txt=&quot;Noyau de l'application&quot; /&gt;
+&lt;str id=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.description.Core&quot; txt=&quot;Fichiers principaux, indispensables au fonctionnement de l'application&quot; /&gt;
+&lt;str id=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.group.Samples&quot; txt=&quot;Fichiers d'exemple&quot; /&gt;
+&lt;str id=&quot;InstallationGroupPanel.description.Samples&quot; txt=&quot;Fichiers d'exemples&quot; /&gt;
+
+If you want to add html markup to those strings, add ``.html`` at the end
+of the string id (after the group name).
