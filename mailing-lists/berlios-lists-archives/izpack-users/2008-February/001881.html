Announcement
===========

I am pleased to announce the immediate release of the version 3.11.0
of the IzPack Java installer generator.

This release will be the last one of the 3.x series, and the last one
of the BerliOS area since IzPack is now a Codehaus project. The next
release will indeed be IzPack 4.0.0.

It can be downloaded from our website at <A HREF="http://izpack.org/.">http://izpack.org/.</A> Issues
can be reported on our JIRA instance at Codehaus.

The complete changelog is available from <A HREF="http://izpack.org/history.">http://izpack.org/history.</A>
Please note that starting from IzPack 4.0.0, we will generate release
notes from JIRA, resulting in more readable informations.

In this release, many small bugs have been fixed. The look and feel
libraries have been upgraded to recent versions. Many translations
have been updated. The icons have been replaced with the ones from the
Tango project. A uniform support for expressing conditional behavior
in the installers has been implemented. Support for Windows 64bits has
been added. A light test has been added so that installers can require
a JDK instead of a JRE to run. XInclude-style constructs for the XML
descriptors has been added. New user input validators have been added.

The documentation has been converted to Docutils. The HTML version is
also available from <A HREF="http://izpack.org/documentation/3.11.0/.">http://izpack.org/documentation/3.11.0/.</A>

A new subproject, called izpack-utils has been launched. It contains
izpack2exe, a Windows self-extracting archive wrapper and izpack2app,
a Mac OS X application bundler.

I would like to thank all the individuals and companies that have
contributed to this release, things would have never been possible
without you :-)
</PRE>
